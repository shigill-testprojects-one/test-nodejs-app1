    <brief_summary>

      This study is a 48-week, Phase IIIb, randomly assigned, open-label, active-controlled,

      multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority study. This study is designed to demonstrate

      the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to the Abacavir (ABC) 600 milligrams

      (mg)/Dolutegravir(DTG) 50 mg/Lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) compared

      with continuing the subject's current suppressive regimen through 24 weeks. The study will

      be conducted in approximately 538 Human Immunodeficiency Virus -1 (HIV-1) infected

      individuals who are on stable suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with 2

      Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a protease inhibitor (PI),

      an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor (INI).

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their current regimen

      (approximately 269 subjects) or be switched to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC (approximately 269 subjects)

      once daily for 24 weeks. At Week 24, individuals originally randomly assigned to continue

      their current regimen will switch to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC and be followed for an additional 24

      weeks. Individuals initially randomly assigned to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC will continue on that

      treatment arm for an additional 24 weeks. A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy will be conducted

      at a small number of sites (approximately 10) to evaluate predose DTG concentrations as well

      as residual drug concentrations of efavirenz (EFV), nevaripine (NVP), amprenavir (APV) and

      tipranavir (TPV) in a subgroup of subjects who switch from EFV, NVP, fosamprenavir/ritonavir

      (FPV/r) or tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r).

             restrictions;



          -  Be likely to complete the study as planned;



          -  Be considered appropriate candidates for participation in an investigative clinical

             trial with oral medication (e.g., no active substance abuse, acute major organ

             disease, or planned long-term work assignments out of the country, etc.).



          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject or the

             subject's legal representative prior to screening



          -  HIV-1 infected men or women &gt;=18 years of age;



          -  A female may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she: a. Is of

             non-childbearing potential either defined as post-menopausal (12 months of

             spontaneous amenorrhea and &gt;=45 years of age) or physically incapable of becoming

             pregnant with documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or,



          -  A female may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she: b. Is of

             childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at both Screening and Day 1 and

             agrees to use one of the following methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy:

             Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of study

             drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of all

             condom/diaphragm, diaphragm/spermicide); Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published

             data showing that the expected failure rate is &lt;1% per year ; Male partner

             sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the study and this male is the

             product label and for at least 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. A

             childbearing potential female subject who starts the study using complete abstinence

             as her contraceptive method and decides to become sexually active must use the double

             barrier method either as a bridge to an approved hormonal contraception (if possible)

             or as a method of choice to be maintained from that moment onwards.



          -  All subjects participating in the study should be counselled on safer sexual

             subjects on an INI, their INI at Screening must be RAL or Elvitegravir (EVG)



          -  Any switch to a second line regimen, defined as change of a single drug or multiple

             drugs simultaneously, must have occurred due to tolerability and/or safety concerns.

             obtained.



          -  Eligibility of subjects for study participation will be decided by the investigators

             after taking into consideration various country specific guidelines, and

             notwithstanding the above mentioned minimum inclusion and exclusion criteria.

    <official_title>A Phase III Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of MK-1439A Once-Daily Versus ATRIPLA™ Once-Daily in Treatment-Naïve HIV-1 Infected Subjects</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the antiretroviral activity of MK-1439A, a

      single-tablet, once-daily (q.d.) fixed-dose combination (FDC) containing MK-1439 100 mg +

      lamivudine 300 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, with ATRIPLA™, a single-tablet FDC

      containing efavirenz 600 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg,

      in treatment-naive participants infected with HIV. The primary hypothesis is that MK-1439A

      q.d. is non-inferior to ATRIPLA™ q.d. as assessed by the proportion of participants with

      HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL (by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay) at Week 48.
