Patients with active uveitis will be randomized, with a 1:1 allocation ratio, to treatment with either the fluocinolone acetonide implant or standardized systemic therapy consisting of oral corticosteroids and supplementary immunosuppressive drugs when indicated, according to standardized guidelines. The design outcome variable for the study is visual acuity; other outcomes include other aspects of visual function, success in controlling uveitis, retinal morphologic outcomes, quality of life, costeffectiveness, and occurrence of potential ocular and systemic complications of uveitis and of therapy. \r\n\r\nSPECIFIC AIMS:\r\nObjectives and Study Hypotheses 2.1 Specific aims of the MUST Trial: 1) To compare the visual outcomes of patients with uveitis treated with the sustainedrelease intraocular fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy to those treated with systemic therapy using oral corticosteroids supplemented by corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs when indicated; 2) To compare the efficacy of the alternative treatment strategies for controlling uveitis and ameliorating/preventing structural complications of uveitis over time; 3) To compare the rates of local ocular corticosteroid-induced complications and the rates of systemic complications between the treatment groups; 4) To compare the self-reported quality of life of the treatment groups. \r\n\r\n2.2 HYPOTHESES: 1) Patients randomized to implant therapy will have better visual outcomes. 2) Patients randomized to implant therapy will have improved control of uveitis, a decreased rate of posterior segment structural complications of the uveitis (such as cystoid macular edema and epiretinal membranes), and an increased rate of corticosteroid-induced ocular complications, such as cataracts, ocular hypertension, and glaucoma. 3) Patients randomized to systemic therapy will have a higher rate of systemic complications, such as diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis. 4) Improved visual outcomes and the absence of systemic corticosteroid complications (and the additional treatments needed to combat them) will result in a better quality of life for patients randomized to implant therapy. \r\n"],"NationalSampleSize":["10"],"NCTNbr":["NCT00132691"],"StudyKeywords":["ORIM: Kanchan Sakhrani (QA: 11/9/10)"],"StudyInvIND":["0"],"ClinicalTrial":["Yes"],"CrrcTrack":["Y"]},{"NCTdataId":["NCT00178724"],"SecondaryId":["W81XH-13-2-0040"],"BriefTitle":["North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury - Registry"],"OfficialTitle":["North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) for Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury"],"LeadSponsorClass":["Robert G.

It would provide benefit in generating appropriate referrals to neurological specialists early in disease progression. False negatives could be tolerated but false positives cannot (i.e. high specificity required with acceptable sensitivity).\r\n\r\nThe test will identify people with ALS and distinguish ALS from disorders that present with similar symptoms (e.g. carpal tunnel, radiculopathies, myopathies). A test with high sensitivity for ALS can be very useful for specialty neurologist as well for early and accurate detection for inclusion in clinical trials. Blood (plasma and DNA) and CSF samples will be collected at multiple sites representing the four regions of the United States from age and gender matched healthy individuals, disease mimics, and ALS patients.\r\n\r\nSpecific aim 2 is to assess how biomarkers discovered in aim 1 change with disease course. Blood samples will be collected longitudinally from ALS and suspected ALS volunteers. Plasma and DNA samples will be collected at Screening/Baseline visit or at months 6, 12, or 18 visits for analysis and will be stored for future DNA research. For the neurological disease and healthy control volunteers who already had blood and or CSF collected for the study, they will be contacted and asked to participate in the DNA portion of the study.

A blood stem cell transplant\r\n\r\n      is a treatment option for someone with a severe form of the disease.

Defective hemoglobin damages red blood\r\n\r\n      cells. The damaged cells, in turn, can block blood flow in vessels and block oxygen and\r\n\r\n      nutrients from reaching organs. For people with severe forms of SCD, one treatment option is\r\n\r\n      a bone marrow transplant, which may correct the abnormal blood cell production problem.

Ideally, graft cells should be\r\n\r\n      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and\r\n\r\n      able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and\r\n\r\n      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that\r\n\r\n      administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically\r\n\r\n      with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests\r\n\r\n      that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly,\r\n\r\n      transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse\r\n\r\n      ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in\r\n\r\n      experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem\r\n\r\n      cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several\r\n\r\n      cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart\r\n\r\n      itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and\r\n\r\n      skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and\r\n\r\n      patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects\r\n\r\n      of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studies clinically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for\r\n\r\n      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone\r\n\r\n      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this\r\n\r\n      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority\r\n\r\n      of the trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and\r\n\r\n      problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available\r\n\r\n      to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart\r\n\r\n      failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important\r\n\r\n      alternative for this disease.\r\n\r\n    "],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"StartDate":["August 2008"],"CompletionDate":["September 2013"],"Phase":["Phase 1/Phase 2"],"StudyType":["Interventional"],"StudyPhase":["Phase 1/Phase 2"],"StudySource":["University of Miami"],"StudyCondition":["Stem Cell Transplantation"],"studyLocation":["University of Miami Miller School of Medicine"],"Enrollment":["65"],"NctKeyword":["Chronic Ischemic Left Ventricular Dysfunction, "],"MeshKeyword":["Heart Failure, Ventricular Dysfunction, Ventricular Dysfunction, Left, "],"Eligibility":["\r\n\r\n        Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Diagnosis of chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Be a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Been treated with appropriate maximal medical therapy for heart failure or\r\n\r\n             post-infarction left ventricular dysfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Ejection fraction less than or equal to 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Able to perform a metabolic stress test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Exclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Baseline glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml/min/1.73m2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Presence of a mechanical aortic valve or heart constrictive device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Documented presence of aortic stenosis (aortic stenosis graded as ≥+2 equivalent to\r\n\r\n             an orifice area of 1.5cm2 or less).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Documented presence of moderate to severe aortic insufficiency (echocardiographic\r\n\r\n             assessment of aortic insufficiency graded as ≥+2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -  Evidence of a life-threatening arrhythmia (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ≥ 20\r\n\r\n             consecutive beats or complete heart block) or QTc interval > 550 ms on screening ECG.\r\n\r\n             In addition;

Sedative medications, which help keep people calm\r\n\r\n      and reduce anxiety, are often prescribed for children who are on mechanical ventilators.\r\n\r\n      However, the longer that sedative medications are used, the longer a child may need to\r\n\r\n      remain on mechanical ventilation.

however, if the child is deemed too\r\n\r\n                       unstable for such a procedure they may still be enrolled as long as\r\n\r\n                       pre-treatment peripheral blood and serum have been submitted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    -  For all other INSS stages: tumor tissue should be obtained as soon as\r\n\r\n                       possible within 96 hours of EMERGENT therapy initiation; patients without\r\n\r\n                       tumor tissues submitted within this time-frame are not eligible for\r\n\r\n                       enrollment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         -  Note: it may not be possible to obtain all necessary tumor biomarkers\r\n\r\n                            for therapy stratification in such cases;

tumor tissue submission is therefore not\r\n\r\n                       required for these patients to enroll on ANBL00B1; a peripheral blood and\r\n\r\n                       serum sample is the only specimen required to be submitted for this group\r\n\r\n                       of patients;

Its incidence is 22.5 new cases each year per 100,000 overweight women of\r\n\r\n      childbearing age, and is rising [Garrett, et al., 2004] in parallel with the obesity\r\n\r\n      epidemic. It affects about 100,000 Americans. Most patients suffer debilitating headaches.\r\n\r\n      Because of pressure on the optic nerve (papilledema), 86% have some degree of permanent\r\n\r\n      visual loss and 10% develop severe visual loss [Wall, et al., 1991]. Interventions to\r\n\r\n      prevent loss of sight, all with unproven efficacy, include diet, diuretics such as\r\n\r\n      acetazolamide, repeated spinal taps, optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery, and\r\n\r\n      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures. The purported goal of these therapies is to\r\n\r\n      lower intracranial pressure; however, it is unclear which treatments work and by what\r\n\r\n      mechanism. None of these strategies has been verified by properly designed clinical trials.\r\n\r\n      Thus, there is confusion, uncertainty, and weak scientific rationales to guide treatment\r\n\r\n      decisions. This trial will study subjects who have mild visual loss from IIH to (1)\r\n\r\n      establish convincing, evidence-based treatment strategies for IIH to restore and protect\r\n\r\n      vision, (2) follow subjects up to 4 years to observe the long-term treatment outcomes and\r\n\r\n      (3) determine the cause of IIH. To meet those aims, the trial will be divided into a\r\n\r\n      12-month intervention phase and a 3-year observational phase. Subjects are not required to\r\n\r\n      complete the observational phase of the study, but will be asked to do so and consented for\r\n\r\n      the observational phase of the study at the conclusion of the intervention phase (12\r\n\r\n      months).\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      Clinical Phase: Phase II Investigators: NORDIC Network sites Study Centers: 38 study centers\r\n\r\n      Coordinating Center - University of Rochester Statistical Center - University of Rochester\r\n\r\n      Study Period Planned enrollment duration: 2 years Planned duration of treatment: 6 months\r\n\r\n      followed by open-label treatment Planned duration of follow-up: 4.5 years Study Objectives:\r\n\r\n      The primary objective is determining the efficacy of diet plus acetazolamide vs diet alone\r\n\r\n      in reducing or reversing visual loss in subjects with mild visual loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The secondary objective is to identify proteomic and genetic risk factors for IIH by\r\n\r\n      screening a large cohort of IIH patients and controls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Study Population This project will enroll 166 individuals with IIH who are 18-60 years of\r\n\r\n      age.

BTAI is when the aorta\r\n\r\n      has been injured due to traumatic force to the chest area. It is commonly caused by motor\r\n\r\n      vehicle accidents. In most cases it is life threatening and the standard treatment is\r\n\r\n      surgery. Many times when a person has a BTAI they also have other injuries that can affect\r\n\r\n      the results of the surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Since stent grafting has been an effective way to treat other aortic conditions such as\r\n\r\n      aneurysms (bulge in aorta wall), it is believed that the Valiant stent graft would be\r\n\r\n      effective in treating BTAI. A stent graft is a woven polyester tube (graft) supported by a\r\n\r\n      metal frame of strong but flexible nitinol (type of metal) springs (stent) that is placed in\r\n\r\n      the aorta to help seal the injury and keep it from bleeding.\r\n\r\n    "],"OverallStatus":["Active, not recruiting"],"StartDate":["April 2010"],"CompletionDate":["May 2017"],"Phase":["N/A"],"StudyType":["Interventional"],"StudyPhase":["N/A"],"StudySource":["Medtronic Endovascular"],"StudyCondition":["Blunt Thoracic Aortic Injury"],"studyLocation":["University of Alabama"],"Enrollment":["50"],"NctKeyword":["Thoracic Aneurysm, Thoracic Transection, Endovascular Aortic Repair, "],"MeshKeyword":["Wounds and Injuries, "],"Eligibility":["\r\n\r\n        Inclusion Criteria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -

Given the numerous risk factors to be examined and the potential for interactions, a large sample size is required and no single center would be able to efficiently recruit sufficient numbers of cases and controls. \r\n\r\nThus, we propose to perform a multi-center case-control study of ICH. All cases and controls will be recruited using identical interview processes and phenotype definitions, handling of biologic samples, centralized neuroimaging analysis and case and control identification using identical methods. This methodology would represent a critical advantage to performing a large genome-wide association study of ICH including minorities.\r\n\r\nOur specific aims are:\r\n\r\n1) In anticipation of a large, genome-wide association study of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) among minorities, we will collect 1000 cases of ICH among whites, 1000 cases among African Americans and 1000 cases among Hispanics and 3000 demographically matched controls. The cases will be identified using uniform case criteria, risk factor data definitions and data collection methods, centralized control identification through random digit dialing and with identical interviews, and biologic sample collection. One in every 5 ICH will undergo a study-required MRI with gradient echo imaging in addition to collection of routine clinical scans. One in every 5 ICH will also have samples processed for proteomics and transciptomics. While our long-term goal is to perform a major genome-wide association study for ICH among blacks and Hispanics, a critical next step is to collect cases and controls in a scientifically rigourous way. This will allow us to take into account important environmental, traditional and genetic factors in our design of a GWAS as well to better understand the epidemiology of ICH among minorities. \r\n\r\n2) Identify differences in risk factor distribution by race, ethnicity and location of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using a case-control design. Preliminary data suggests that significant differences in risk factors exists by race and ethnicity. Our sample size will achieve sufficient power to account for multiple comparisons and to examine the importance of genetic risk factors such as apolipoprotein E alleles. Prior studies have lacked sufficient cases with DNA samples to determine the importance of this risk factor in minority populations. \r\n\r\n3) Determine differences in imaging characteristics among AAs and Hispanic ICH Cases compared to Whites using a case-only comparison. Most studies of microbleeds have been limited to non-Hispanic white ICH cases. While an existing effort to examine microbleeds among AA ICH cases is underway, at present, there has been no studies of microbleeds among Hispanics with ICH or sufficient collection of cases from all three groups for a comparison to be made. Through the proposal, we will gather available CT and MRI neuroimaging on every case (occuring within the first seven days of admission). To avoid biases in clinical practice of ordering MRI, one in every five cases in which an MRI can be safely performed will have a study-related MRI. Using a case-only comparison (as controls will not have neuroimaging performed as part of the study), and including covariates identified as significant risk factors for ICH through the case-control study, we will be able to characterize differences by race/ethnicity in volume of ICH, location of ICH, number and location/topography of microbleeds, and severity of underlying white matter disease (leukoaraiosis). \r\n\r\n4) Determine differences in outcomes of ICH based on race/ethnicity compared to non-Hispanic whites using a case-only comparison. Studies in ischemic stroke suggest variable outcome based on a number of factors including socioeconomic factors. ICH tends to affect AAs and Hispanics at a younger age than non-Hispanic whites (hereafter whites) and has a higher morbidity and mortality rate than ischemic stroke. However, no study has determined the risk factors for these differences in outcomes by race/ethnicity and for long-term outcome (1 year) or, in particular, examined differences based on location and treatment of risk factors.\r\n\r\n5) Determine level of population admixture between centers, ethnicity and race using a control-only analysis. Hispanic Americans may differ in their ancestry (Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican or other national background). Similarly, African Americans and whites may demonstrate admixture when comparing individuals from southern United States to Midwest or Northeastern regions. Determining the degree of population admixture will be an important factor for consideration in analysis of candidate genes as well as for a planned genome-wide association study. To accomplish this aim, we will genotype 176 ancestry informative markers as well as genotype approximately 250 candidate gene polymorphisms obtained from genome scans among whites and priority candidate genes and estimate the admixture porportions in the 3000 cases and 3000 controls. Using these markers, we can analyze controls from each racial/ethnic group and as a whole for significant clusters or subpopulations for consideration in designing a future GWAS.\r\n\r\nThus upon completion of the study, we will have sufficient power to examine all known risk factors for ICH among AAs and Hispanics including known genetic risk factors and those implicated by results of ongoing GWAS studies among whites, we will have created a neuroimaging repository and a biologic sample repository of ICH including DNA isolation with quality control measures, ancestry informative markers genotyped as well as samples processed for proteomics and transciptomics for future studies which have been gathered on cases undergoing case identification and classification using uniform definitions and risk factor data collection.

This hypothesis will be tested using a composite outcome including: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and non-MI acute coronary syndrome ascertained over a follow-up period of up to 6 years. Interim monitoring for overall trial efficacy will be based on the accrued rate of this primary outcome. The anticipated event rate for this outcome is 2.2%/year. \r\n\r\nSubgroup Hypotheses:\r\nSPRINT will examine intervention effects in a number of subgroups; Two subgroups are of particular interest due their connection to possible biological mechanisms affecting the primary outcome: \r\n1. participants with and without CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73m2) at baseline, 2. participants < or &#8805; 75 years at baseline.\r\n\r\nConsistency of the effects for the intervention on the primary outcome will also be examined in subgroups defined by gender, race/ethnicity (black vs. non-black), presence of clinical CVD at baseline (i.e., primary and secondary prevention participants) and tertiles of baseline systolic BP.\r\n\r\nSubgroup analyses for secondary outcomes are described in Chapter 10 of the protocol. \r\n\r\nSecondary Hypotheses: \r\nSPRINT prespecifies two types of secondary hypotheses. The first type will address secondary outcomes in analyses designed to support and confirm the primary analysis. These will include components of the primary composite outcome, total mortality, and a composite of the primary composite with total mortality (CVD-free survival). The other type addresses two areas of non-cardiovascular clinical effects: renal and cognitive outcomes. \r\n\r\nObjectives for renal outcomes and the CKD subgroup:\r\n1. For the CKD subgroup, we will determine whether the intensive intervention arm experiences a lower rate of a composite of renal outcomes composed of: ESRD or A 50% decline from baseline eGFR \r\n2. For the non-CKD subgroup, we will determine whether the intensive intervention arm experiences a lower rate of progression to CKD, defined as  ESRD or  30% decrease from baseline eGFR and an end value of <60 ml/min/1.73M2 \r\n\r\nSPRINT MIND:\r\nSPRINT-MIND is an integral part of the overall SPRINT study and all SPRINT participants will participate in one or more components of SPRINT-MIND. There are three objectives of SPRINT-MIND. The primary objective is to determine whether a strategy of intensive blood pressure lowering to target systolic blood pressure (SBP) <120 mm Hg versus a standard treatment target of 140 mm Hg will produce a greater reduction in the incidence of all-cause dementia. The second objective is to determine whether global cognitive function measured in key specific domains of cognition will decline less in persons randomized to a SBP goal of <120 mm Hg versus a standard treatment goal of 140 mm Hg in a representative sub-sample of approximately 2800 SPRINT participants. The third objective is to assess whether MRI-derived changes in brain structure differ by treatment assignment in a subset (approximately 640) of the 2800 participants.\r\n\r\nSPRINT MIND Hypotheses:\r\n1. All-cause Dementia. The incidence of all-cause dementia will be lower in SPRINT participants assigned to the intensive SBP treatment arm compared to their counterparts assigned to the standard SBP treatment arm.\r\n2. Cognitive Decline. The combined rate of decline in all domains of cognition will be slower in the intensive SBP treatment arm compared to the standard SBP treatment arm. This hypothesis will be tested in a randomly selected subset of 2800 participants enrolled in SPRINT. \r\n3. MRI Brain Changes. The volume small vessel ischemic disease (SVID) will be lower in SPRINT participants assigned to the intensive SBP treatment arm compared to their counterparts assigned to the standard SBP treatment arm. A sub-hypothesis is that total brain volume will also be greater (thus less atrophy) in the intensively treated group. The MRI sub-study will be conducted in 640 participants chosen from the 2800 selected to receive regular extensive cognitive assessment."],"NationalSampleSize":["120"],"NCTNbr":["NCT01206062"],"StudyKeywords":["ORIM: Kanchan Sakhrani"],"StudyInvIND":["0"],"ClinicalTrial":["Auto/Blank"],"CrrcTrack":["Y"]},{"NCTdataId":["NCT01208974"],"SecondaryId":["SCCC-2009004"],"BriefTitle":["Nipple-Areola Complex (NAC) Irradiation After Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy and Reconstruction"],"OfficialTitle":["A Phase I Trial Assessing the Safety and Feasibility of Prophylactic Nipple-Areola Complex (NAC) Irradiation After Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy and Immediate Reconstruction in Patients With In-Situ or Invasive Breast Cancer"],"LeadSponsorClass":["University of Miami"],"SponsorAgency":["Other"],"LeadSponsor":["University of Miami"],"OversightAuthority":["Yes"],"BriefSummary":["\r\n\r\n      Overall rationale: Prophylactic NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and\r\n\r\n      immediate reconstruction for patient with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer\r\n\r\n      will allow better cosmesis and patient's satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Study design: Phase I trial assessing the safety, feasibility and toxicity of prophylactic\r\n\r\n      NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in\r\n\r\n      patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Primary objective: To determine the recommended phase I dose of post-operative prophylactic\r\n\r\n      NAC irradiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Secondary objectives: To provide extensive descriptive data regarding NAC-sparing surgery\r\n\r\n      with reconstruction, including both surgeon experience and patient evaluation of cosmetic\r\n\r\n      results.

this study is:\r\nTo evaluate the antiviral efficacy (sustained virologic response [SVR]; defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks following treatment cessation) of 16 and 24 weeks of a 4-drug regimen with tegobuvir and 24 weeks of a 3-drug regimen of GS-9451 without tegobuvir (GS-9190), all with peginterferon alfa 2a (PEG), and ribavirin (RBV) followed by response guided PEG/RBV with a control arm of PEG/RBV therapy for 48 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe secondary objectives of this study include the following:\r\n To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapy in each treatment arm\r\n To evaluate the emergence of viral resistance following therapy\r\nwith GS-9451 when administered with PEG and RBV with and without tegobuvir\r\n To characterize viral dynamics and steady state pharmacokinetics of GS-9451 and tegobuvir when administered with PEG and RBV\r\n\r\nExploratory objectives of this study include the following:\r\n Assess genetic variation in the human IL28B gene as a predictor of virologic response in each treatment arm\r\n Through genetic discovery research (i.e. pharmacogenomics) in subjects who provide their additional and specific consent: to identify or validate genetic markers that may be predictive of the natural history of HCV disease, the virologic response to therapy, and the tolerability of drugs used in HCV therapeutics.\r\n\r\nResistance Registry Substudy objective:\r\n To evaluate HCV resistance profiles and the persistence of selected viral resistant mutations in subjects who do not achieve SVR \r\n\r\nLong-term SVR Registry Substudy objective:\r\n To evaluate the durability of response in subjects who achieve SVR\r\n\r\nOpen-label Retreatment Substudy objectives:\r\n To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of 24 weeks of therapy with GS-9451,

Ideally, graft cells should be\r\n\r\n      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and\r\n\r\n      able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and\r\n\r\n      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that\r\n\r\n      administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically\r\n\r\n      with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests\r\n\r\n      that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly,\r\n\r\n      transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse\r\n\r\n      ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in\r\n\r\n      experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem\r\n\r\n      cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9,\r\n\r\n      several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing\r\n\r\n      within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of\r\n\r\n      whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both\r\n\r\n      post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction\r\n\r\n      and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have\r\n\r\n      also been studied clinically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for\r\n\r\n      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone\r\n\r\n      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this\r\n\r\n      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority\r\n\r\n      of the trials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive\r\n\r\n      therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of\r\n\r\n      eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less\r\n\r\n      than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      This is a Pilot Study, intended as a safety assessment prior to a full comparator study.

INH is a\r\n\r\n      medication that is prescribed for people with latent TB to help prevent active TB from\r\n\r\n      developing. The standard INH treatment regimen is 6 to 9 months; a shorter treatment regimen\r\n\r\n      may prove to be as effective and may improve adherence.

Although radiation therapy to the pelvis has been a\r\n\r\n      standard and important part of treatment for rectal cancer and has been shown to decrease\r\n\r\n      the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area in the pelvis, some patients experience\r\n\r\n      undesirable side effects from the radiation and there have been important advances in\r\n\r\n      chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation which may be of benefit. The purpose of this study is\r\n\r\n      to compare the effects, both good and bad, of the standard treatment of chemotherapy and\r\n\r\n      radiation to chemotherapy using a combination regimen known as FOLFOX, (the drugs\r\n\r\n      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin and leucovorin) and selective use of the standard\r\n\r\n      treatment, depending on response to the FOLFOX.

Most of the medications prescribed for schizophrenia have\r\n\r\n      no effect on reducing marijuana use. Preliminary data suggests that clozapine, an atypical\r\n\r\n      antipsychotic, may limit marijuana use in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, but it is not\r\n\r\n      commonly used due to its side effects and is reserved for people who do not respond to other\r\n\r\n      antipsychotic medications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In the proposed study, 132 individuals who are diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a\r\n\r\n      cannabis use disorder will be randomized to a 12-week treatment course with either clozapine\r\n\r\n      or risperidone (another commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication) to test the hypothesis\r\n\r\n      that patient treated with clozapine will have decreased cannabis use as compared to patients\r\n\r\n      treated with risperidone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Should this study indicate that clozapine will lessen marijuana use in persons diagnosed\r\n\r\n      with schizophrenia more than risperidone, it will provide evidence needed to begin to shift\r\n\r\n      clinical practice toward its use in this population.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      Cannabis use disorder (CUD), which is up to ten times more common in patients with\r\n\r\n      schizophrenia (SCZ) than in the general population, worsens the course of this severe\r\n\r\n      psychiatric disorder. Since SCZ occurs in 1% of the population, the co-occurrence of CUD in\r\n\r\n      13% to 42% of people with this disorder presents society with an important public health\r\n\r\n      problem. Unfortunately, most antipsychotics available for treatment of patients with SCZ do\r\n\r\n      not appear to limit their cannabis use. Moreover, the one antipsychotic that preliminary\r\n\r\n      data suggest may well limit cannabis use in these patients, clozapine (CLOZ), is not used\r\n\r\n      for this purpose; it is reserved for patients whose psychosis is treatment resistant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The overarching idea behind this proposal, however, is that CLOZ's use is being unreasonably\r\n\r\n      restricted and should be made more widely available for patients with SCZ who have a\r\n\r\n      co-occurrin"],"OverallStatus":["Active, not recruiting"],"StartDate":["April 2013"],"CompletionDate":["June 2018"],"Phase":["Phase 4"],"StudyType":["Interventional"],"StudyPhase":["Phase 4"],"StudySource":["Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center"],"StudyCondition":["Schizophrenia"],"studyLocation":["CNS Network Inc"],"Enrollment":["132"],"NctKeyword":["Schizophrenia, Cannabis Abuse, Cannabis Dependence, Dual Diagnosis, Clozapine, Risperidone, "],"MeshKeyword":["Schizophrenia, Marijuana Abuse, "],"InterventionKeyword":["Risperidone, Clozapine, "],"Eligibility":["\r\n\r\n        Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          -

Caffeine is a\r\n\r\n      stimulant of the respiratory center and has been used for the treatment of Apnea of\r\n\r\n      Prematurity in infants not requiring mechanical ventilation or to facilitate weaning from\r\n\r\n      mechanical ventilation by starting therapy shortly before extubation. Recently the use of\r\n\r\n      Caffeine in ventilated infants has been initiated earlier because of the reported reduction\r\n\r\n      in BPD. However there is paucity of data supporting this practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Because protracted mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen increase the risk of\r\n\r\n      developing BPD, a therapy that would facilitate the reduction of the respiratory support and\r\n\r\n      shorten its duration is desirable. Therefore, it is of importance to evaluate the effects of\r\n\r\n      early Caffeine initiation and administration during the course of mechanical ventilation in\r\n\r\n      preterm infants by means of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hypothesis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The primary hypothesis of this study is that early use of caffeine in mechanically\r\n\r\n      ventilated preterm infants will reduce the time to first elective extubation and\r\n\r\n      secondarily, that this will reduce the total duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen\r\n\r\n      supplementation, and reduce the incidence and severity of BPD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Objective:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of early caffeine use during\r\n\r\n      mechanical ventilation on the time to first elective extubation, total duration of\r\n\r\n      mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation, and the incidence of BPD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Study Design:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      This will be a single-center prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled\r\n\r\n      clinical trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Population:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Premature neonates born between 23 and 30 completed weeks of gestation, who require\r\n\r\n      mechanical ventilation within the first 5 days of life will be enrolled.

The current standard treatment for severe hemophilia A is\r\n\r\n      infusion of FVIII to stop bleeding, or regular scheduled treatment to prevent bleeds from\r\n\r\n      occuring. Due to the short half-life of FVIII, prophylaxis may require treatment as often as\r\n\r\n      every other day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In this trial safety and efficacy of a long-acting recombinant Factor VIII molecule is being\r\n\r\n      evaluated in 50 male subjects, < 12 years of age, with severe Hemophilia A.

Youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV will show a greater decrease in HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors, laboratory-confirmed STD incidence, drug use, arrests and out of home placements, and mental health symptoms from baseline assessment through 6 months post-baseline than youths in SAU.\r\nHypothesis 1b. Youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV will show a greater decrease in HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors, laboratory-confirmed STD incidence, drug use, arrests and out of home placements, and mental health symptoms from 6 months post baseline to 24 months post-baseline than youths in SAU.\r\nHypothesis 1C. Youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV will be more likely to successfully transition out of the juvenile justice day treatment program--and return to regular school placement--than those assigned to services as usual.\r\n\r\nAim 2: Moderating Effects  To identify baseline client characteristics that moderate intervention outcomes.\r\nHypothesis 2. For youths with high baseline levels of co-morbidity, HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors, drug use and delinquency, the DT-MDFT-HIV intervention will reduce HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors and laboratory-confirmed STD incidence, drug use, and arrests and out of home placements more significantly than the DT-SAU condition. For youths with low baseline levels of HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors, drug use and delinquency, the two interventions will be comparably effective.\r\n\r\nAim 3: Mechanisms of Action  To identify the mechanisms through which the experimental intervention achieves its effects.\r\nHypothesis 3a. For youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV, reductions in HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors and laboratory-confirmed STD incidence will be achieved through (a) increases in HIV/STD knowledge and risk-reduction skills, (b) enhanced self-efficacy regarding condom use, (c) improved communication and refusal skills with partners, (d) greater perceived peer norms supportive of safer sex, (e) open communication with parents about HIV and sexual risk behaviors, and (f) more effective parenting and improved family functioning. \r\nHypothesis 3b. For youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV, reductions in drug use and delinquency will be achieved through (a) increases in adolescents bonding to prosocial peers and activities (e.g. school), (b) increases in parents emotional bonding to their adolescent, and improvements in parenting practices, and (c) more positive family environment.\r\n\r\nAim 4: Economic Analyses - To evaluate and compare the economic costs, benefits, and cost effectiveness to society and to the juvenile justice system of DT-MDFT-HIV and DT-SAU.\r\nHypothesis 4a. DT-MDFT-HIV will generate significantly higher total and net monetary benefits to society and to the juvenile justice system than youths in DT-SAU.\r\nHypothesis 4b.

The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those\r\n\r\n      infants who are at risk for future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that\r\n\r\n      the investigators might intervene to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The\r\n\r\n      objective of this clinical trial is to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal\r\n\r\n      kidney function and size in infants born preterm during the first 2 years of life. This will\r\n\r\n      be done through the use of standard serum and urine markers as well as non-invasive\r\n\r\n      ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of this clinical trial is that a subgroup of\r\n\r\n      patients born preterm and of low birth weight will demonstrate early markers of kidney\r\n\r\n      injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and low kidney size.

The proposed clinical\r\n\r\n      trial is innovative because it will investigate the risk factors for kidney dysfunction at a\r\n\r\n      pre-clinical stage with the idea of gaining more knowledge regarding therapeutic\r\n\r\n      interventions. In addition, the study will assess serum cystatin C as a surrogate test for\r\n\r\n      glomerular filtration rate which could indicate worsening kidney function at an earlier\r\n\r\n      stage than serum creatinine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify at-risk patients for\r\n\r\n      future renal impairment and to prospectively monitor the persistence of proteinuria and its\r\n\r\n      effect on kidney function in the short term.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      Objectives and Hypotheses:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early\r\n\r\n      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in later life.

The cancer stem cell theory\r\n\r\n      suggests that most tumors undergo a process of differentiation through which a relatively\r\n\r\n      rare cancer stem or progenitor cell (CSC) gives rise to more differentiated populations of\r\n\r\n      cells (including transiently amplifying cells) comprising the bulk of the tumor. As a result\r\n\r\n      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to\r\n\r\n      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key\r\n\r\n      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the\r\n\r\n      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many\r\n\r\n      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in\r\n\r\n      CSC. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs\r\n\r\n      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigators' research program focuses on\r\n\r\n      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of\r\n\r\n      small molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are\r\n\r\n      fundamental to CSCs.

The main limitations of islet transplantation are\r\n\r\n      the need for systemic immunosuppression to maintain function and the loss of islet function\r\n\r\n      over time. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated that the current site of\r\n\r\n      transplantation in the liver is not an ideal site due to several factors. These factors\r\n\r\n      include (1) significant liver inflammation following islet infusion; (2) potential for\r\n\r\n      life-threatening procedure-related complications such as bleeding and thrombosis; (3) high\r\n\r\n      levels of immunosuppressive drugs and GI toxins in the liver contributing to islet toxicity;\r\n\r\n      (4) the inability to retrieve islets after infusion; and (5) development of graft\r\n\r\n      dysfunction in a number of recipients of intrahepatic allogeneic and autologous islets. The\r\n\r\n      implantation of islets into the omentum will allow adequate engraftment of islets onto the\r\n\r\n      omentum and will lead to comparable or superior functional and clinical outcomes than in the\r\n\r\n      traditional intrahepatic site.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      Islet transplantation will be performed in subjects with unstable Type 1 diabetes mellitus\r\n\r\n      under permanent immunosuppression.

As a result\r\n\r\n      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to\r\n\r\n      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key\r\n\r\n      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the\r\n\r\n      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many\r\n\r\n      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in\r\n\r\n      esc. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs\r\n\r\n      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigator's research program focuses on\r\n\r\n      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of\r\n\r\n      small molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are\r\n\r\n      fundamental to CSCs. Our preliminary results identified a novel Notch associated protein\r\n\r\n      NACK that functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Notch. Moreover, Nack is expressed\r\n\r\n      in human solid tumors and is required for cell survival and tumor growth in notch -dependent\r\n\r\n      tumor cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The investigator's aim is to further interrogate the link between Notch and Nack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Specific Aims:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        -  Identify and isolate the cancer stem cell populations from primary chemo naive\r\n\r\n           esophageal tumor samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        -  Interrogate the status of the Notch,( the link between Notch and Nack), Wnt and Hedghog\r\n\r\n           pathways in the chemo naive esophageal tumor as well as in specific cell populations,\r\n\r\n           such as the CSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        -  Determine the degree of cross-talk between these pathways and which of these pathways\r\n\r\n           is essential for the self renewal properties and tumorigenic properties of the esc\r\n\r\n           population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        -

For patients with non-APL AML, ATRA has little effect.\r\n\r\n      Consequently, 85% of these patients will succumb to their disease despite conventional\r\n\r\n      approaches. Little is known about mechanisms of resistance to ATRA in non-APL AML. This\r\n\r\n      knowledge gap limits the use of ATRA in a disease that already has few effective therapies.\r\n\r\n      The investigators' preliminary data suggest that non-APL AML cells can be re-sensitized to\r\n\r\n      ATRA when combined with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) inhibitors. The investigators'\r\n\r\n      publication in Nature Medicine showed that LSD1 inhibition with tranylcypromine (TCP),\r\n\r\n      unlocked the ATRA-driven therapeutic response in non-APL AML. Notably, treatment with ATRA\r\n\r\n      and TCP markedly diminished the engraftment of primary human AML cells in murine models,\r\n\r\n      indicating that the combination may target leukemia-initiating cells (LIC). The\r\n\r\n      investigators' data identify LSD1 as a therapeutic target and strongly suggest that it may\r\n\r\n      contribute to ATRA resistance in non-APL AML. The investigators' central hypothesis is that\r\n\r\n      ATRA combined with TCP will be safe and effective in a clinical population, and that this\r\n\r\n      approach will suppress LICs and restore myeloid differentiation programs in patients with\r\n\r\n      non-APL AML. Testing this hypothesis with the phase I clinical trial outlined in this\r\n\r\n      protocol, will establish a new treatment paradigm in AML and extend the important\r\n\r\n      anti-cancer effects of ATRA to all AML subtypes.\r\n\r\n    "],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"StartDate":["February 2015"],"Phase":["Phase 1"],"StudyType":["Interventional"],"StudyPhase":["Phase 1"],"StudySource":["University of Miami"],"StudyCondition":["Acute Myelogenous Leukemia"],"studyLocation":["University of Miami"],"Enrollment":["25"],"NctKeyword":["Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, AML, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, MDS, Tranylcypromine, TCP, ATRA, Tretinoin, "],"MeshKeyword":["Leukemia, Syndrome, Leukemia, Myeloid, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Preleukemia, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, "],"InterventionKeyword":["Tranylcypromine, Tretinoin, "],"Eligibility":["\r\n\r\n        Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          1.

Wounds on the lower leg\r\n\r\n      heal more slowly than wounds on the head and neck; they can also remain deep red for six\r\n\r\n      months to one year. Doctors usually allow a lower leg surgical wound to heal by itself,\r\n\r\n      without stitches or other additional treatment. This is because leg wounds do not hold\r\n\r\n      stitches well and stitches could cause other problems. A major drawback of allowing a\r\n\r\n      surgical wound on the lower leg to heal by itself is the long healing time that can often\r\n\r\n      take months. The investigators wish to evaluate if the LED light treatment of the surgical\r\n\r\n      wound will improve the healing of your wound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      In order to test if leg wounds heal faster after treatment with LED, half of the patients in\r\n\r\n      the study will receive the LED (Group 2) and half will not receive treatment with LED but\r\n\r\n      will receive a \"sham light\" treatment (Group 1). Essentially, a sham light treatment refers\r\n\r\n      to regular light (not LED) exposure for 20 minutes. The sham light comes from the same\r\n\r\n      device as the treatment light (Omnilux machine) however, this light has no anticipated\r\n\r\n      effects on wound healing and is used simply to reduce the amount of bias that sometimes\r\n\r\n      complicates the results of these studies. There is no added risk or benefit for the patients\r\n\r\n      in the control group exposed to the sham light.

In consequence, the\r\n\r\n      skin is extremely fragile which can result in shearing of the skin, causing a high risk of\r\n\r\n      infection.

Determining the onset of the\r\n\r\n      disease, predicting its severity and the benefit of pressure lowering eye drops is key to\r\n\r\n      clinical management aimed at maintaining useful vision with advancing age. This study will\r\n\r\n      longitudinally monitor a population of glaucoma suspects (with positive factors for the\r\n\r\n      disease but with normal vision) with noninvasive pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and other\r\n\r\n      standard eye tests for glaucoma. The PERG measures the function of retinal ganglion cells\r\n\r\n      (RGCs) that are the parent neurons of the optic nerve. RGCs may become dysfunctional before\r\n\r\n      dying and their function restored with pressure-lowering eye drops. Glaucoma suspects with\r\n\r\n      abnormal PERG will be randomized to treatment with eye drops, while those with normal PERG\r\n\r\n      will be left untreated. All patients will be monitored with PERG, Optic Coherence Tomography\r\n\r\n      (OCT) and other ancillary tests every 6 months over 4 years.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      The PERG is recorded from small metallic buttons taped on the skin similarly to an\r\n\r\n      electrocardiogram, with the difference that the electrodes are around the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The only physical contact you will experience is a gentle cleaning of the skin with an\r\n\r\n      alcohol prep pad. During the test you must look with both eyes at a Television (TV) display\r\n\r\n      for about 3 minutes. During the follow up period you may be asked to take one more PERG test\r\n\r\n      lying down in a bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      This will cause a momentary increase of your eye pressure similar to the one that occurs\r\n\r\n      during your normal sleep. This may help to understand whether or not your optic nerve\r\n\r\n      functions normally when the pressure in your eye increases. For OCT evaluation, the pupil\r\n\r\n      has to be dilated with drops as you did before for your eye exam.

This requires a urinary diversion\r\n\r\n      to be performed. The most common type of urinary diversion in this setting is an ileal\r\n\r\n      conduit, where a section of small intestine is fashioned into a conduit that drains urine\r\n\r\n      through a stoma into a pouch appliance, which is adhered at the level of the abdominal wall\r\n\r\n      skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      There are multiple risk factors associated with the development of parastomal hernia after\r\n\r\n      ileal conduit formation, including obesity, stoma site and size of the abdominal wall stoma\r\n\r\n      opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Up to 30% of patients with parastomal hernia will undergo surgical correction, mainly due to\r\n\r\n      discomfort, urine leakage, skin excoriation, difficulty in maintaining a watertight ostomy\r\n\r\n      appliance, increased frequency of ostomy pouch changes, or rarely due to bowel\r\n\r\n      strangulation. Parastomal hernia repair is a challenging procedure which is not without\r\n\r\n      significant risks. Furthermore, the outcomes of parastomal hernia repair surgery are highly\r\n\r\n      variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Prevention of parastomal hernia resulting from ileal conduit formation will help to decrease\r\n\r\n      the incidence of hernia related complications, including pain, bowel complications, and\r\n\r\n      urinary leakage due to poor stoma appliance. It will also decrease the significant cost\r\n\r\n      associated with frequent stoma pouch changes. Prevention of parastomal hernia is expected to\r\n\r\n      improve the quality of life of patients undergoing ileal conduit, and will reduce the need\r\n\r\n      for secondary operations.\r\n\r\n    "],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"StartDate":["August 2015"],"CompletionDate":["April 2021"],"Phase":["N/A"],"StudyType":["Interventional"],"StudyPhase":["N/A"],"StudySource":["University of Miami"],"StudyCondition":["Parastomal Hernia"],"studyLocation":["University Of Miami Hospital"],"Enrollment":["60"],"NctKeyword":["Hernia, Mesh, Ileal conduit, "],"MeshKeyword":["Hernia, "],"Eligibility":["\r\n\r\n        Inclusion Criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          1.

Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled for each\r\n\r\n      disease group. In all but the melanoma group, Toca 511 will be administered by IV injection\r\n\r\n      for 3 consecutive days (14 mL per day); in the melanoma group, at least 3 subjects may\r\n\r\n      receive Toca 511 by IV injection (same dosing regimen as the other 3 groups), and at least 3\r\n\r\n      subjects will receive Toca 511 by IL injection (approximately 0.1 mL to 4 mL for 5\r\n\r\n      consecutive days). Based on the disease group, subjects will have either multiple core\r\n\r\n      biopsies or a resection of a metastatic lesion (primary for subjects with renal cell\r\n\r\n      carcinoma undergoing debulking nephrectomy), approximately 14 to 28 days after Toca 511\r\n\r\n      administration. A portion of the resected or biopsied tumor sample will be evaluated for the\r\n\r\n      presence of Toca 511 vector sequences and markers for disease characteristics. After\r\n\r\n      recovery from the biopsy or surgery (approximately 4-6 weeks from Toca 511 treatment start),\r\n\r\n      subjects will begin the first cycle of oral Toca FC (ie, a 7 day course of 220 mg/kg/day;\r\n\r\n      thereafter, cycles of 7-day courses of Toca FC will be repeated approximately every 6\r\n\r\n      weeks). Toca FC may be continued alone or in conjunction with standard therapy (other\r\n\r\n      investigational treatments prohibited). One or more disease groups may be expanded to allow\r\n\r\n      replacement of subjects or to provide a better assessment of efficacy.

The study will\r\n\r\n      take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send\r\n\r\n      them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the\r\n\r\n      subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and\r\n\r\n      destroying cancer cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back\r\n\r\n      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the\r\n\r\n      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in\r\n\r\n      subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order\r\n\r\n      to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional\r\n\r\n      subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells\r\n\r\n      back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the\r\n\r\n      subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years\r\n\r\n      after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the\r\n\r\n      subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the\r\n\r\n      blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years,\r\n\r\n      then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      This is first time in human study is a single-arm study of genetically engineered MAGE\r\n\r\n      A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells in HLA-A*0201 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb\r\n\r\n      or V) NSCLC.

Patients suffer from\r\n\r\n      multiple organ fibrosis whereas lung fibrosis (interstitial lung disease, ILD) is one of the\r\n\r\n      main driver for mortality. There is preclinical evidence for efficacy of nintedanib in SSc\r\n\r\n      and associated ILD (SSc-ILD) and the anti-fibrotic efficacy of nintedanib was proven in\r\n\r\n      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients, who are presenting a similar pattern regarding lung\r\n\r\n      fibrosis. Hence it is the purpose of the trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of\r\n\r\n      nintedanib 150 mg bid in treating patients with SSc-ILD, compared with placebo.

Minority construction workers, in particular, have\r\n\r\n      higher smoking and lower cessation rates compared to other groups, and they generally show\r\n\r\n      lower access and participation in cessation and health promotion services. The number of\r\n\r\n      Hispanic workers employed in the construction industry in the US has tripled in the past\r\n\r\n      decade to 2.6 million (23% of all construction workers). This study will develop,\r\n\r\n      administer, and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program in a hard-to-reach and\r\n\r\n      underserved population of Hispanic male construction workers using using pilot cluster\r\n\r\n      randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the developed intervention for feasibility and\r\n\r\n      potential efficacy.\r\n\r\n    "],"Description":["\r\n\r\n      A two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 14 construction sites,\r\n\r\n      selected from one Construction Company in south Florida. Cluster randomization is used with\r\n\r\n      construction site chosen as the unit of allocation because it is most practical in this\r\n\r\n      setting and minimizes the risk of spillover effects from the intervention to the control\r\n\r\n      group. Computer-generated random selection will be used to select 14 out of 27 construction\r\n\r\n      sites of one company (Coastal) in south Florida. Then, construction sites will be randomly\r\n\r\n      assigned to the intervention (7 sites in the enhanced care) or the control group (7 sites in\r\n\r\n      the standard care), and study participants working in these sites will receive treatment\r\n\r\n      accordingly. In conjunction with the lunch truck, the investigators will recruit 9 adult\r\n\r\n      Hispanic construction workers who smoke ≥5 cigarettes/day per site (126 total).
