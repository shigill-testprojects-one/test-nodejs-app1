      The primary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of

      observational data that can be used to study HSC transplantation.



      A secondary purpose of the Research Database is to have a comprehensive source of data to

      study marrow toxic injuries.



      Objectives:



      To learn more about what makes stem cell transplants work well, such as determining the

      following:



        -  how well recipients recover from their transplant



        -  how recovery after a transplant can be improved



        -  how access to transplant for different groups of patients can be improved



        -  how well donors recover from the collection procedures

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to collect 650 blood and 300 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples

      from people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), pure lower or upper motor neuron

      diseases, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases and from people with no neurological

      disorder. Through comparison of these samples, the researchers hope to learn more about the

      underlying cause of ALS, as well as find unique biological markers, which could be used to

      diagnose ALS and monitor disease progression.



      Additionally, up to 600 blood samples will be collected for a sub-study for DNA analysis.

      Studying components of the blood, such as DNA, may help us understand what happens when

      genes function abnormally and how it might be related to disease.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Researchers tested what changes happen in volunteers with ALS that can be seen in the blood

      and what changes are unique to ALS and are different from those found in healthy volunteers

      and volunteers with neurological diseases other than ALS. These changes are called

      biomarkers. Biomarkers for ALS have been found in blood collected in earlier phases of this

      study. Biomarkers are non-genetic elements in your blood that may help to make diagnosing

      ALS easier. In the next phase, comparison of these changes in the blood of volunteers with

      ALS and without ALS will be used to confirm these biomarkers and to develop a tool to

      diagnose and monitor progression of ALS.

    <detailed_description>

      This Phase 3 trial is an open-label extension study of the placebo-controlled, double-blind

      VRX-RET-E22-301 trial. Patients who have completed the VRX-RET-E22-301 trial and who meet

      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with 600-1200 mg/day of retigabine as an

      adjunct therapy to their current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve stimulation.

      Treatment will be continued until retigabine is commercially available, or until the program

      is discontinued. Patients will be recruited from 45-50 sites in the United States, Canada,

      Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. The safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with

      retigabine administered as adjunctive therapy in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset

      seizures will be evaluated. In addition, the efficacy of long-term treatment with retigabine

      and patient quality of life will be assessed.

      RATIONALE: To evaluate the efficacy of a new high intensity chemotherapy regimen with

      rituximab maintenance in patients with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma



      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving rituximab together with combination

      chemotherapy followed by rituximab works in treating patients with previously untreated

      mantle cell lymphoma.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        -  To evaluate progression-free survival of patients with previously untreated mantle cell

           lymphoma treated with rituximab in combination with methotrexate, doxorubicin,

           cyclophosphamide, leucovorin, vincristine, ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine and mesna

           (R-MACLO/IVAM)



      Secondary



        -  To evaluate overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.



        -  To evaluate the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.



        -  To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.



      OUTLINE:



      Cycle 1, patients will receive rituximab IV, doxorubicin IV bolus, vincristine IVP on day 1;

      cyclophosphamide IV on day 1-5; vincristine IVP on day 8; methotrexate IV follow by

      methotrexate via continuous infusion on day 10, then leucovorin 100mg/m^2 IV, followed by

      leucovorin 10mg/m^2 IV until methotrexate level is below 0.01 nM on day 11. Patients will

      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 13 and continuing

      until blood counts recover.



      When absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches 1,500/mm^3 two consecutive times, patients will

      start cycle 2. Patients will receive rituximab IV on day 1; cytarabine IV on day 1 and 2;

      ifosfamide IV, mesna IV, etoposide IV on day 1-5; and G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 7 and

      continuing until ANC is greater than 1,000 cells/mm^3.



      Approximately 7-14 days later, patients receive another course of therapy as above.



      Patients who achieve complete remission after completion of course 4 receive rituximab IV

      once weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 months for up to 3 years in the absence

      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every

      6 months for 3-5 years, and then yearly thereafter.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a regimen

      containing once-daily elvitegravir (EVG) versus twice-daily raltegravir (RAL) added to a

      background regimen (1 fully-active ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) plus 1 or

      2 additional antiretroviral (ARV) agents) in HIV-1 infected, ARV treatment-experienced

      adults who have documented resistance, or at least six months experience prior to screening

      with two or more different classes of ARV agents.



      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive EVG plus background regimen

      (Elvitegravir group), or raltegravir plus background regimen (Raltegravir group). Due to

      known drug interactions, participants in the Elvitegravir group receiving RTV-boosted

      atazanavir (ATV) or RTV-boosted lopinavir (LPV) as part of their background regimen will

      receive elvitegravir at a lower dose (85 mg).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The background regimen will be constructed by the investigator based on viral resistance

      testing. The fully active PI will be defined by phenotypic resistance analysis. For

      phenotypic susceptibility, fully active is defined as being below the lower clinical or

      biological cutoff. Participants are required to take their ritonavir dose based on the

      dosing schedule indicated in the prescribing information for the PI; no additional ritonavir

      is required to be taken with EVG. No other marketed PIs are allowed as part of the

      background regimen due to unknown drug interactions.



      The second agent can be one nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI),

      etravirine, maraviroc, or T-20. However, the second agent must not include an integrase

      inhibitor; the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors efavirenz, nevirapine, or

      delavirdine (due to unknown drug interactions); or the fixed-dose combination therapies

      Atripla® or Trizivir® (abacavir sulfate/lamivudine/zidovudine). The second agent may or may

      not be fully active (except in Spain, where participants have to receive a fully active

      second agent, as requested by the Spanish regulatory agency).



      If the M184V/I reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation is present on the screening genotype

      report and an NRTI is used as the second agent, then either FTC or LAM may be added as a

      third agent in the background regimen to maintain the M184V/I mutation. In this situation

      only, the fixed-dose combination therapies Combivir®, Truvada®, or Epzicom/Kivexa® may be

      prescribed as the combined second and third agents of the background regimen.



      After Week 96, participants will continue to take their blinded study drug and attend visits

      until treatment assignments are unblinded, at which point they will be given the option to

      participate in an open-label EVG extension phase of the study.

    <brief_summary>

      The investigators propose to conduct a Phase I/randomized Phase II study design in order to

      test the tolerability and efficacy of AZD0530 when used together with anastrozole in therapy

      for ER+ and/or PR+, postmenopausal breast cancer. The Phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort of

      the study (cohort A) in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer 2008-2009 showed

      initial safety,tolerability and good bioavailability of both drugs and determined the doses

      for use in the ongoing Phase II trial. In the randomized Phase II cohort of the study

      (cohort B), postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed, previously untreated ER+, HER2

      negative breast cancer that is at least 2 cm or more in diameter by clinical exam or

      radiology will be randomized to either neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole plus placebo,

      or anastrozole in combination with AZD0530. The Phase II cohort will permit extended assays

      of tolerability, initial estimates of efficacy, and the investigation of molecular

      predictors of drug efficacy.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy



          -  Resting EKG with measurable QTc interval of &gt;480msec at 2 or more time points within

             a 24 hr period.



          -  AZD0530 is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4. Since concurrent administration of

             AZD0530 with other CYP3A4 substrates has been shown to be well tolerated,

             continuation or initiation of medically indicated drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4

             is permitted at MD discretion. Drugs listed in Appendix XI that are known to strongly

             induce or inhibit CYP3A4 activity should be discontinued prior to study entry and

             should not be initiated during protocol treatment.



          -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic psychiatric or medical conditions

             (eg. Severe hepatic impairment, interstitial lung disease [bilateral, diffuse,

             parenchymal lung disease]) or current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or

             cardiac conditions which make it undesirable for the patient to participate in the

             study or which could jeopardize compliance with the protocol



          -  Evidence of underlying pulmonary dysfunction as evidenced by oxygen saturation &lt;90%

             by pulse oximetry prior to study entry and/or symptomatic pulmonary (pleural or

             parenchymal) disease.



          -  Subjects unwilling or unable to undergo breast MRI as required by protocol will be

             excluded from study

    <brief_summary>

      Background:



      - The Children s Oncology Group has established a research network, the Childhood Cancer

      Research Network (CCRN), to collect information about children with cancer and other

      conditions that are benign but involve abnormal cell growth in order to help doctors and

      scientists better understand childhood cancer. The CCRN's goal is to collect clinical

      information about every child diagnosed with cancer and similar conditions in the United

      States and Canada, to allow researchers to study patterns, characteristics, and causes of

      childhood cancer. The information can also help researchers study the causes of childhood

      cancer. To expand the CCRN, parents of children who have been diagnosed with cancer will be

      asked to provide information about themselves and their child for research purposes.



      Objectives:



        -  To obtain informed consent from parents (and the child, when appropriate) of infants,

           children, adolescents, and young adults newly diagnosed with cancer to enter their

           names and certain information concerning their child into the Childhood Cancer Research

           Network.



        -  To obtain informed consent from parents (and the child, when appropriate) of infants,

           children, adolescents, and young adults newly diagnosed with cancer for permission to

           be contacted in the future to consider participating in non-therapeutic and prevention

           research studies involving the parents and/or the child.



      Eligibility:



      - Parents of children who have been seen at or treated by a hospital that is a member of the

      Children s Oncology Group.



      Design:



        -  Parents will provide permission to have personal information sent from their child s

           hospital to the CCRN, including the child and parents' names; child's gender, birth

           date, race, and ethnicity; information about the disease; and the treating institution.



        -  Parents will also give permission for CCRN to contact the diagnostic laboratory to

           obtain specific information about the tumor or cancer cells.



        -  Parents will be asked if they are willing to be contacted in the future to consider

           participating in CCRN research studies, and will provide contact information (name,

           home address, and telephone number) to be entered in the CCRN.



        -  Parents or patients who change their minds about having information available in the

           CCRN can ask the treatment institution to restrict access to the identifying

           information. Parents or patients who refuse to have information included in the CCRN or

           be contacted in the future will still be able to enter clinical cancer research

           studies.

    <detailed_description>

      Background:



        -  Institutional membership in the Children s Oncology Group (COG) requires registration

           of all pediatric cancer patients seen at their site. This registration process includes

           all patients.



        -  In order to maximize the resource that a network would provide, it is necessary to have

           identifying information on a large proportion of the cases included within the network.

           Moreover, the resource would be further enhanced if informed consent from

           parents/patients was obtained to allow future contact regarding possible participation

           in non-therapeutic and prevention research.



      Objectives:



        -  To obtain informed consent from parents of infants, children, adolescents, and young

           adults newly diagnosed with cancer (and their child when appropriate) to enter their

           names and certain information concerning their child into the Childhood Cancer Research

           Network and/or for permission to be contacted in the future to consider participating

           in future studies.



        -  For children under the age of majority at the time of parental consent: Once the child

           reaches the age of majority, to obtain informed consent from that child to allow

           her/his name and other identifying information to continue to be available to the

           Childhood Cancer Research Network and/or to be possibly contacted in the future to

           consider participating in other studies.



      Eligibility:



        -  Pre-CCRN Entry



        -  All new patients seen in COG member institutions with any of the following diagnoses

           are eligible:



           -- All cancer cases with an ICD-O histologic behavior code of two 2 (carcinoma in situ)

           or three 3 (malignant).



        -  -All lesions of the central nervous system regardless of behavior, i.e., benign,

           borderline or malignant.



             -  The benign/borderline conditions which will be reportable by agreement shall

                include: Mesoblastic nephroma, all teratomas, regardless of locations, Theca cell

                - granulosa cell tumor, lymphoproliferative disease, ganglioneuroma,

                myeloproliferative disease, Langerhan s Cell histiocytosis



      Design:



      If consent to enter the patient in ACCRN07 is obtained:



        1. Using the patient s COG ID, the CCRN consent will be added to their record and the

           patient will be considered registered with COG.



        2. Depending on the response on the consent form, the record will be flagged for a yes or

           no to possible contact for future studies in the CCRN.



      If consent is not obtained to enter the patient in ACCRN07



        1. For those parents/patients who refuse the CCRN consent, they will still be able to be

           enrolled on any COG clinical trial (therapeutic and non- therapeutic) for which the

           patient is eligible. The unique COG ID will be used to identify the patient.



        2. The information collected as part of the study entry procedures will not be available

           to the CCRN. The record will be flagged as refusing participation in the CCRN.



        3. If consent is later obtained for enrollment in the CCRN, the patient must be entered in

           ACCRN07 using the patient s unique COG ID.

    <brief_summary>

      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause

      of cervical cancer. Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of

      the uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this

      is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer

      of the cervix. This study will supplement an ongoing study evaluating the safety, efficacy

      and immunogenicity of the vaccine in women aged 26 years and above. This study will

      therefore assess additional immunogenicity parameters of the vaccine in women from selected

      investigative sites.



      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep

      2007.

      This research trial studies kidney tumors in younger patients. Collecting and storing

      samples of tumor tissue, blood, and urine from patients with cancer to study in the

      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid

      (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Classify patients with renal tumors by histological categorization, surgico-pathological

      stage, presence of metastases, age at diagnosis, tumor weight, and loss of heterozygosity

      for chromosomes 1p and 16q, to define eligibility for a series of therapeutic studies. (Loss

      of heterozygosity [LOH] testing discontinued as of April 2014) II. Maintain a biological

      samples bank to make specimens available to scientists to evaluate additional potential

      biological prognostic variables and for the conduct of other research by scientists.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Monitor outcome for those patients who are not eligible for a subsequent therapeutic

      study.



      II. Describe whether the pulmonary tumor burden correlates with outcome in stage IV

      patients.



      III. Describe the sensitivity and specificity of abdominal computed tomography (CT) by

      comparison with surgical and pathologic findings for identification of local tumor spread

      beyond the renal capsule to adjacent muscle and organs, lymph node involvement at the renal

      hilum and in the retroperitoneum, preoperative tumor rupture, and metastases to the liver.



      IV. Compare the sensitivity and specificity of pre-operative abdominal CT scan and magnetic

      resonance imaging (MRI) for the identification and differentiation of nephrogenic rests and

      Wilms' tumor in children with multiple renal lesions.



      V. Correlate the method of conception (natural vs assisted reproductive technology) with the

      development of Wilms' tumor.



      VI. To evaluate the frequency of integrase interactor 1 (INI1) mutations in renal and

      extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney and to determine the incidence of germline

      and inherited versus somatic mutations to facilitate clinical correlations on the companion

      study AREN0321. (INI1 testing discontinued as of April 2014)



      OUTLINE:



      Tumor tissue, blood, and urine samples are collected for research studies, including

      immunohistochemistry. CT scans and MRIs are also performed. Loss of heterozygosity analyses

      (chromosome 1p and 16q) are performed by extraction of DNA. DNA polymorphisms are assayed by

      polymerase chain reaction using standard methodology. Leftover specimens are archived for

      future studies. (LOH and INI1 testing discontinued as of April 2014)



      Patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept) in

      individuals with new onset T1DM will improve insulin secretion (C-peptide production)

      compared to placebo.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease in which

      insulin-producing beta cells are completely or near completely destroyed resulting in

      life-long dependence on exogenous insulin.



      CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept) inhibits a crucial stimulatory pathway in the activation of T cells. By

      this mechanism, the drug is thought to arrest or slow the T cell mediated autoimmune

      destruction of beta-cells and preserve their function. At the time of clinical onset of

      T1DM, a significant amount of insulin producing beta cells are destroyed, but as many as

      10-20% are still capable of insulin production. By using CTLA4-Ig close to the onset of

      T1DM, we hope to arrest or slow down the autoimmune destruction of these beta-cells and

      extend the endogenous insulin production. CTLA4-Ig regulates T cell function but does not

      deplete T cells. Therefore, its safety profile appears to be better than other

      immunosuppressive agents.



      Eligible participants will be randomized to the experimental or control groups. The

      experimental group will receive intravenous infusions of CTLA-4 Ig. The first infusion will

      occur at the time of randomization, followed by another infusion 2 and 4 weeks later.

      Subsequent infusions will be given monthly for two years during the treatment phase of the

      study. There is a total of 27 infusions during the treatment phase of the study.



      Participants in the control group will receive intravenous infusions of placebo according to

      the same schedule outlined above.



      Both groups will receive standard intensive diabetes treatment with insulin and dietary

      management.



      All participants randomized into the study will be seen at study site monthly for 24 months

      and then every 6 months for up to an additional 2 years. Participants will undergo

      assessments of their insulin production, immunologic status, overall health and well being

      and diabetes care.

      This is a single-center, prospective, open label study in islet transplant recipients after

      complete islet graft rejection/loss, defined as stimulated c-peptide ≤0.3 ng/mL.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      After complete islet graft loss is determined, patient's maintenance immunosuppression (i.e.

      sirolimus and tacrolimus) will be discontinued and they will be placed on Myfortic®

      monotherapy for 2 years thereafter. After completion of two years of Myfortic® maintenance

      monotherapy, it will be weaned and subjects will be monitored over the subsequent twelve

      months, for the appearance of sensitization using panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels.

      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed

      cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or

      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be

      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and

      able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and

      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that

      administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically

      with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests

      that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly,

      transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse

      ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in

      experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem

      cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several

      cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart

      itself. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and

      skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and

      patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects

      of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studies clinically.



      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for

      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone

      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this

      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority

      of the trials.



      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and

      problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available

      to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart

      failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important

      alternative for this disease.

    <brief_summary>

      Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is an inherited blood disease

      that can cause organ damage, stroke, and intense pain episodes. A blood stem cell transplant

      is a treatment option for someone with a severe form of the disease. Prior to undergoing a

      transplant, people typically receive a conditioning regimen of high doses of chemotherapy

      and other medications to prepare the body to accept the transplant. A conditioning regimen

      that uses lower doses of chemotherapy and medications may be safer for transplant

      recipients. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of blood stem cell

      transplants, using bone marrow from unrelated donors, in children with severe SCD who

      receive a reduced intensity conditioning regimen prior to the transplant.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      SCD is an inherited blood disorder. Symptoms include anemia, infections, organ damage, and

      intense episodes of pain, also called "sickle cell crises." SCD is caused by an abnormal

      type of hemoglobin, which is a protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen to vital

      organs, such as the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys. Defective hemoglobin damages red blood

      cells. The damaged cells, in turn, can block blood flow in vessels and block oxygen and

      nutrients from reaching organs. For people with severe forms of SCD, one treatment option is

      a bone marrow transplant, which may correct the abnormal blood cell production problem. In

      most cases, bone marrow transplants are performed in people who have a healthy sibling with

      the same tissue type. If people do not have a sibling with the same tissue type, it is

      possible for them to receive a blood stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor through

      bone marrow transplant .



      Traditionally, people with SCD who are undergoing a bone marrow transplant receive high

      doses of chemotherapy and medications before the transplant as part of the conditioning

      regimen to prepare their immune system to accept the donor cells. Participants will

      experience fewer side effects with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen than with a more

      intense conditioning regimen. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and

      effectiveness of blood stem cell transplants, using bone marrow from unrelated donors, in

      children with severe SCD who receive a reduced intensity conditioning regimen before the

      transplant. Specifically, researchers will evaluate whether the reduced intensity

      conditioning regimen is successful in allowing donor cells to settle and grow successfully,

      in preventing the production of SCD-damaged red blood cells, and in limiting SCD-related

      organ damage.



      This study will enroll children with severe SCD who lack a sibling with the same tissue type

      who can serve as their donor. Participants will attend a study visit prior to the transplant

      to undergo a blood collection, neurocognitive testing to measure learning and brain

      function, and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

      Questionnaires to assess quality of life will also be completed. Twenty-two days before the

      transplant, participants will begin receiving a reduced intensity conditioning regimen of

      chemotherapy and medications to prepare them for the transplant. Eight days before the

      transplant, participants will be admitted to the hospital and will continue the conditioning

      regimen. Participants will then receive the bone marrow transplant. After the transplant,

      participants will receive immunosuppression medications for at least 6 months to prevent

      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which may occur if the immune cells from the donated bone

      marrow attacks the body of the recipient. One week after the transplant, participants will

      receive granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is a natural protein that

      increases the white blood cell count and helps protect the body against infections.

      Participants will receive G-CSF until their white blood cell level is normal again.

      Participants will remain in the hospital and be closely monitored for signs of infection or

      other complications until study researchers feel it is safe for them to return home.



      After leaving the hospital, participants will attend study visits weekly during Weeks 1 to

      8, at Day 60, weekly during Weeks 9 to 14, at Day 100, at Month 6, and at Years 1 and 2. At

      all study visits, a blood collection, medical history review, and physical exam will occur.

      In addition, at Day 100, Month 6, and Years 1 and 2, questionnaires to assess quality of

      life will be completed. At select visits the following procedures will also occur: lung

      function testing, heart function testing, MRA and MRI scans, and neurocognitive testing.

      The NACTN Spinal Cord Injury Registry is a network of clinical centers collecting

      de-identified data from patients admitted through the Emergency Department of a NACTN center

      at the time of injury with an initial (first time) spinal cord injury (SCI). Information

      will be collected on the natural history of SCI and course of treatment through the first 12

      months from the date of injury or long as medically indicated. Data collected includes

      imaging information from CT or MRI scans, neurological and general medical outcome and

      rehabilitation evaluation. No intervention is given other than standard of care for spinal

      cord injury.

      The Data Management Center is located at:



      The University of Louisville, Louisville



      Preliminary work has been completed on the selection of data elements, data collection

      protocols, case record form design, and the design of a computer system for clinical data

      management and data quality control.



      In the first phase of the network, data will be collected on the natural history of SCI.

      Although there is considerable data in the literature about the natural history of SCI,

      current changes in treatment appear to be modifying the natural history. In particular very

      early surgery, including decompression of the spinal cord and vertebral stabilization with

      instrumentation appears, in some cases of SCI, to be improving outcomes.



      No treatment is given other than standard of care for SCI. Data is collected in hopes to

      help SCI patients in the future.

      This laboratory study is collecting and storing samples of tissue and blood from young

      patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue and blood

      from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the

      future.

      OBJECTIVES:



      I. Establish a biologic specimen repository (of tumor tissue, tissue arrays, lymphoblastoid

      cell lines, host DNA, tumor and host RNA, serum, and plasma) and database linked to clinical

      features and outcomes from well-characterized cohorts of children and young adults with

      Hodgkin's lymphoma.



      II. Provide specimens from diagnosis, early response evaluation, completion of chemotherapy

      and radiotherapy, long-term follow up, and relapse to study prognostic factors for early

      response, relapse, long-term outcomes, and identification of new biological targets for

      therapy.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.



      Patients enrolled on Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) therapeutic clinical trials undergo collection

      of tumor tissue samples at baseline and at relapse or disease progression. Serum and

      anticoagulated peripheral blood samples are collected at baseline, at week 1, on day 1 of

      course 2, after completion of chemotherapy, after completion of radiotherapy, at 1 year

      after diagnosis, and at relapse or disease progression.



      Patients with relapsed or progressive disease who plan to enroll on HL relapse/retrieval

      clinical trials undergo collection of tumor tissue, serum, and anticoagulated peripheral

      blood samples at relapse or disease progression.



      Patients enrolled more than 1 year after completion of treatment undergo collection of tumor

      specimens, serum, and anticoagulated peripheral blood samples at time of clinical

      evaluation.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of antiretroviral (ARV)

      and tuberculosis (TB) medications in pregnant women and their infants. (Pharmacokinetics are

      the various interactions between a drug and the body.) This study will also evaluate the PKs

      of certain ARVs in postpartum women before and after starting hormonal contraceptives. The

      PKs of these drugs will be evaluated by measuring the amount of medicine present in blood

      and/or vaginal secretions.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Pregnant women experience unique physiological changes that may result in clinically

      significant alterations in drug PKs. Unfortunately, there have been few clinical trials to

      study the PKs of ARV, TB, and hormonal contraceptive drugs in pregnant women. The

      development of appropriate dosing regimens for the HIV-infected pregnant woman is critical

      to the health of both mother and fetus. Overdosing may lead to maternal adverse events and

      increased risk of fetal toxicity, while underdosing may lead to inadequate virologic

      control, increased risk of developing drug resistance mutations, and a higher rate of

      perinatal HIV transmission. This study will evaluate the PKs of ARVs used during pregnancy;

      evaluate TB drugs used during pregnancy, both in women who are HIV-positive and also taking

      ARVs and in women who are HIV-negative and not taking ARVs; and evaluate the PKs of hormonal

      contraceptive medications taken along with ARVs.



      There will be five main groups of study arms: HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs

      without TB treatment, HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs with first-line TB treatment,

      HIV-uninfected pregnant women taking no ARVs with first-line TB treatment, HIV-infected and

      HIV-uninfected pregnant women with or without ARVs with second-line TB treatment for

      drug-resistant TB, and HIV-infected postpartum women taking ARVs and hormonal

      contraceptives. Participants will not receive medications through this study—they will

      continue on ARV, TB, and/or contraceptive medications prescribed by their health care

      providers.



      Women who are 20 0/7 weeks to 37 6/7 weeks pregnant will be enrolled in this study and will

      remain in the study for up to 12 weeks after delivery. Postpartum women will be enrolled at

      2 to 12 weeks after delivery and followed until 6 to 7 weeks after starting contraceptives.

      Infants will be followed for 16 to 24 weeks of life. At all study visits, participants will

      undergo a medical history, a physical exam, and blood collection. At some visits, women in

      some arms will undergo a vaginal swab. Blood collection from the mother and the detached

      umbilical cord will occur during delivery. Intensive PK sampling will be performed at study

      visits during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and/or postpartum, depending on

      the study arm. Additional study visits may occur depending on the ARV drug regimen

      prescribed.

      The hypothesis is that humoral and cellular islet-specific responses are an early risk

      factor for recurrence of autoimmunity and hyperglycemia in simultaneous pancreas-kidney

      (SPK) recipients independent of alloimmunity. This study will test the hypothesis and will

      assess their individual and combined predictive value.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      To identify the factors associated with recurrence of diabetes in subjects who received a

      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) or pancreas transplant. The study will see if there are

      changes in the participant's blood that will help the investigator know whether diabetes has

      returned after the transplant.



      SPK patients will be retrospectively analyzed to determine frequency, levels and time course

      of autoantibody recurrence and predictive value of autoantibodies for recurrence of the

      disease.



      This study will prospectively follow our existing and our new pancreas transplant recipients

      to monitor autoantibody levels, monitor and phenotype autoreactive T cells in peripheral

      blood. This will happen monthly for 24 months.



      This study will assess the presence or absence of insulitis in the transplanted pancreas

      from biopsies performed in recipients with consistent recurrence of multiple autoantibodies.



      It will also monitor and phenotype autoreactive T cells from the pancreatic infiltrate

      obtained by pancreatic transplant biopsies.

      SMARTT will estimate the incidence of conditions and diagnoses potentially related to in

      utero exposure to antiretroviral therapy and/or exposure in the first two months of life

      among children born of HIV-infected mothers.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Many antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications given to a pregnant woman cross the placenta

      and can be detected in the amniotic fluid and cord blood resulting in substantial fetal

      exposure. Therefore, there is concern about toxicity of the drugs in the fetus and infant.

      It is noteworthy that none of the currently approved ART medications for the prevention of

      maternal to fetal transmission of HIV are in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pregnancy

      Category A (no fetal risk ascertained in adequately controlled human studies). Thus, there

      is continued need to examine the toxicity of ART in HIV transmission prevention for the

      short-term toxicity of newer agents and combinations as well as the unanswered questions of

      longer term toxicity and subtle adverse effects.



      The study will use a registry approach to conduct active surveillance among children &lt; 12

      years of age at enrollment. Occurrences of abnormalities from ART exposure in utero and/or

      in the first two months of life will be sought in multiple domains, including metabolic,

      growth, cardiac, neurologic, neurodevelopmental, behavior, language, and hearing. Clinical

      and laboratory data will be examined for abnormalities through a hierarchy of evaluations:

      adverse events (AE) will be identified → selected AEs will trigger predefined additional

      evaluations → significant observations will be defined as cases → a pattern of significant

      study-wide cases will be defined as signals. The incidence of these events of interest will

      be monitored over time and by ART regimen, and compared with historical data that may be

      suggestive of a signal. Some signals may be testable using existing and/or previously

      collected data, while other signals may indicate the need for additional hypothesis-driven

      studies outside of SMARTT.



      The objectives of SMARTT are:



        1. To estimate the occurrence of potential ART-related toxicities through an ongoing

           surveillance system among HIV-uninfected children born to mothers with HIV infection

           with and without exposure to ART in utero and/or in the first two months of life and

           compare the occurrences of these outcomes with other sources of data as well as by ART

           exposures; and



        2. To actively encourage hypothesis-driven studies to confirm that the signals are due to

           ART exposure in utero and/or in the first two months of life. Note that the full design

           and execution of these studies may be beyond the scope of the SMARTT study but will be

           facilitated by SMARTT.



      The specific aims of SMARTT are:



        1. To create a Static Surveillance Cohort to extend domain-specific data collection in

           children either 1) previously enrolled in any of the approved studies for enrollment

           into SMARTT; 2) previously enrolled in another pediatric HIV/AIDS cohort study with

           SMARTT Protocol Chair approval, or 3) not previously enrolled in an approved study but

           with equivalent data available in the medical record;



        2. To create a Dynamic Surveillance Cohort to examine domain-specific data of children

           newly exposed to ART in utero and/or in the first two months of life;



        3. To identify a set of "triggers" for each domain that define a "signal" of possible ART

           toxicity and compare the occurrence of these signals with previously collected data and

           by ART exposure; and



        4. To encourage and facilitate the development of hypothesis-driven studies to evaluate

           whether a "signal" is the result of ART exposure in utero and/or in the first two

           months of life.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standardized systemic therapy

      versus fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy for the treatment of severe cases of

      non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The MUST trial is a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing two treatments for

      patients with vision-threatening non-infectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or

      panuveitis:



        -  local therapy with fluocinolone acetonide intraocular implant in affected eyes; versus



        -  standard therapy: systemic corticosteroid therapy supplemented, when indicated, by

           corticosteroid-sparing potent immuno-modulator therapy.



      Study ophthalmologists, clinic coordinators, and patients will not be masked to treatment

      assignment. Masking will be applied to the determination of visual function at baseline, the

      six month visit, and thereafter . Patients will be followed until death, participant

      withdrawal, or a common study closeout. Patients will be seen at baseline, one month after

      randomization, three months after randomization, and every three months thereafter for data

      collection. Both ophthalmological and medical data will be collected to evaluate the

      outcomes of treatment of the uveitis, complications of the uveitis, and complications from

      therapy itself. Selected laboratory data related to the complications from systemic

      corticosteroid therapy will be collected.



      The planned sample size of 250 patients, 125 per treatment group, is expected to give

      sufficient power to detect clinically important differences in visual acuity outcomes.

      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria detailed above will be enrolled at approximately

      23 clinical centers in the United States, Australia and UK. Patients will be randomized on a

      1:1 basis to one of the two treatment groups.

    <brief_summary>

      The purposes of this study are:



        1. To reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency in patients with type 1 diabetes

           mellitus through islet transplantation utilizing steroid free, calcineurin-inhibitor

           free immunosuppression.



        2. To assess the long-term function of successful islet transplants in patients with type

           1 diabetes mellitus utilizing islets that have undergone a period of culture.



        3. To determine whether the natural history of the microvascular, macrovascular, and

           neuropathic complications are altered following the successful transplantation of

           islets.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      STUDY DESIGN:



      The initial proposal submitted to the JDRFI was to compare 3 different groups of patients

      receiving islet cell transplants utilizing steroid-free, calcineurin-free protocols. The 3

      groups were as follows:



        1. Zenapax, Rapamycin &amp; MMF



        2. Campath, Rapamycin &amp; MMF, and



        3. Thymoglobulin, Rapamycin &amp; MMF.



      The grant was awarded in December 2003, however the recommendations were to focus on a

      single group (group 3 or 4) in order to determine the relative efficacy and toxicity of a

      new immunosuppressive drug combination. We elected to perform the group utilizing Campath,

      since we have a similar protocol utilizing the same immunosuppressive regimen with the

      addition of CD34+ enriched donor bone marrow cells (2000/0024). The results of this trial

      utilizing a steroid-free/calcineurin-free protocol will be compared with the standard

      "Edmonton Protocol" (2000/0196), which we are currently conducting (14 patients have been

      transplanted). In addition, the results will be compared with those in 2000/0024.



      Protocol 2000/0024 (utilizing the same immunosuppressive regimen; Campath, Rapamycin,

      Tacrolimus-switched to MMF at 3 months) is being followed by a DSMB established at the NIH.



      We propose to evaluate 12 patients with steroid free, long term calcineurin inhibitor free

      immunosuppression regimens which can be directly compared to our historical group of

      patients who underwent the Miami version of the Edmonton protocol (Islet Cell

      Transplantation Alone in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Steroid-Free

      Immunosuppression - Protocol # 2000/196) and with the concurrent tolerogenic protocol (Islet

      Cell Transplantation Alone and CD34+ Enriched Donor Bone Marrow Cell Infusion in Patients

      with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus; Steroid Free Regimen - Protocol # 2000/0024) which uses the

      same immunosuppressive regimen combined with CD34+ stem cell enriched donor bone marrow

      infusions.



      The regimen will consist of Campath 1-H induction, maintenance immunosuppression with

      sirolimus and tacrolimus for 3 months with subsequent introduction of mycophenolate mofetil

      (MMF) and removal of tacrolimus completely and TNF-alpha inhibition (etanercept) in the

      peri-transplant period.

    <eligibility>

        Inclusion Criteria:



        Potential candidates must have type 1 diabetes mellitus and fulfill one or more of the

        following:



          1. Manifest signs and symptoms that are severe enough to be incapacitating.

             Incapacitating signs and symptoms include hypoglycemic episodes requiring assistance

             by others and hypoglycemia unawareness (the inability to recognize low blood

             glucoses; glucoses &lt; 54 mg/dl). These patients are at high risk for involvement in

             accidents (they can lose consciousness or act irrationally), thus causing harm to

             themselves and/or others.



          2. Patients with poor diabetes control (HbA1c &gt; 8.0% but &lt; 12%), despite intensive

             insulin therapy, as defined by: self monitoring of blood glucose ≥ 4 times/day,

             multiple insulin injections (≥ 3/day) or insulin pump, and close monitoring of blood

             glucose control by an endocrinologist. These patients can experience acute, rapid

             hyperglycemia secondary to several stress factors, that can lead to dehydration,

             disorientation, and in some instances, ketoacidosis.



          3. Progressive diabetic complications. These patients with chronically poor glycemic

             control are at higher risk for the development of a wide variety of complications

             (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease) associated with

             diabetes.



        Exclusion Criteria:



        Potential candidates will be excluded as per the following criteria:



          1. Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 65 years

         12. Anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 g/dl for males; &lt; 11 g/dl for females)



         13. Hyperlipidemia (fasting low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol &gt; 130 mg/dl and/or

             fasting triglycerides &gt; 200 mg/dl)



         14. Abnormal liver function tests (consistently &gt; 1.5 x normal range)



         15. Serological evidence of HIV, HBsAg and/or HBcAb, HBsAb without history of

    <brief_summary>

      The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a multi-center trial examining the ability of an

      intensive lifestyle or metformin to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in a high

      risk population due to the presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The DPP has ended

      early demonstrating that lifestyle reduced diabetes onset by 58% and metformin reduced

      diabetes onset by 31%.



      The DPPOS is designed to take advantage of the scientifically and clinically valuable DPP

      participants. This group of participants is nearly 50% minority and represents the largest

      IFG/IGT population ever studied. Clinically important research questions remain that focus

      on 1) durability of the prior DPP intervention, 2) determination of the clinical course of

      precisely known new onset diabetes, in particular regarding microvascular disease, CVD risk

      factors and atherosclerosis, 3) close examination of these topics in men vs women and in

      minority populations.

    <brief_summary>

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of tenofovir disoproxil

      fumarate (TDF, tenofovir DF) compared to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for the treatment of

      HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Participants will receive either TDF or the approved

      hepatitis B therapy ADV. After 48 weeks all participants will be switched to open-label TDF.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Efficacy of TDF versus ADV will be evaluated for histologic improvement, reductions in serum

      HBV DNA, changes in liver enzymes, and the generation of antibody to the virus. Safety will

      be assessed by evaluating adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and the development of

      drug-resistant mutations. After 48 weeks, all participants will receive open-label TDF, and

      the efficacy and safety of TDF will be monitored for the remainder of the study.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the safety of infliximab and ustekinumab in

      patients with plaque psoriasis, and other all forms of psoriasis (such as plaque psoriasis

      and psoriatic arthritis occurring together). The registry study will track the behavior of

      the disease in response to other therapies, such as other biologic drugs. The registry will

      also evaluate clinical outcomes; disease characteristics, including physician reported

      assessment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA); quality of life, and potential risks for patients

      who may receive standard therapies for psoriasis.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PSOLAR is an 8 year registry study. A registry is an observational study that evaluates the

      status of a disease. This registry study will only include patients who volunteer to take

      part. About 2000 infliximab-exposed patients and 4000 ustekinumab-exposed patients as well

      as a comparable number of patients (4000) on other standard of care psoriasis therapies

      (e.g. Etanercept) and/or psoriasis treatments (e.g. topical or light therapy treatments)

      will take part in the registry study, internationally. The Registry does not require any

      study-specific testing, but may capture test information (e.g. laboratory tests, X-rays)

      that are collected as part of normal routine care for the registry program. Patient

      information will be collected at the enrollment visit and about every 6 months thereafter.

      At enrollment, information on demographics (e.g. gender, race, date of birth), medical

      history and family medical history, details of past and current psoriasis treatments (e.g.

      infliximab and standard therapy), and current medication regimens will be collected.

      Clinical follow-up will be based on observations from physical examination, clinical disease

      status, Quality of Life assessment (e.g. Dermatology Life Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety

      and Depression Scale, EQ-5D (EuroQoL-5D is a Quality of Life Questionnaire) Health

      Questionnaire Scale, Employment/Productivity Health Economic Questionnaire), current

      medications, and any adverse events/problems reported. During each six -month follow-up

      visit with the study doctor, information collected will include observations from physical

      examination, updates on clinical disease status, Quality of life assessments, medications

      and adverse events/problems. No study agents will be administered in this registry. All

      patients will receive standard of care treatments prescribed by the patient's physician.

      The proposed study uses a two-arm randomized experimental design to evaluate the efficacy of

      a brief, theoretically-guided, "Prevention Care Advocate" intervention with HIV-positive

      crack users. Study participants will be recruited from the HIV inpatient hospital wards of

      two inner-city hospitals that serve a similar population of HIV-positive patients: Jackson

      Memorial Hospital (JMH) in Miami, Florida and Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta,

      Georgia.

      The proposed study uses a two-arm randomized experimental design to evaluate the efficacy of

      a brief, theoretically-guided, "Prevention Care Advocate" intervention with HIV-positive

      crack users. Study participants will be recruited from the HIV inpatient hospital wards of

      two inner-city hospitals that serve a similar population of HIV-positive patients: Jackson

      Memorial Hospital (JMH) in Miami, Florida and Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta,

      Georgia.



      This 8-session, multi-component, skills-building intervention adapted from strategies used

      in prior studies encourages participants to advocate prevention and receipt of primary care

      services for themselves and their peers. We will employ a randomized experimental design to

      compare the intervention's efficacy with an attention-control group.



      SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of a brief, theoretically-based intervention

      in reducing unprotected sexual intercourse by HIV-positive crack users recruited from the

      inpatient/hospital setting. The impact of the intervention on secondary outcomes including

      the increased use of HIV primary outpatient care and readiness for and entry to drug

      treatment, will also be evaluated.



      Aim 2: To examine whether knowledge, motivation and perceived self-efficacy are impacted by

      the intervention, and if changes in these variables explain change in the behavioral

      outcomes of interest.



      Aim 3: To determine the extent to which behavioral outcomes are maintained over time.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:



        1. To reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency in patients with Type 1 Diabetes

           Mellitus by islet cell transplantation;



        2. To eliminate the incidence of hypoglycemia coma and unawareness in patients with Type 1

           Diabetes Mellitus by islet cell transplantation;



        3. To assess long-term safety and function of successful islet cell transplants in

           patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus;



        4. To determine whether the natural history of the microvascular, macrovascular and

           neuropathic complications of Diabetes Mellitus are altered following successful

           transplantation of islet cells; and



        5. To assess the effect of infliximab in preventing early islet destruction, and thereby

           eliminating the need for a second donor's islet cells.



        6. To assess the effect of etanercept in preventing early islet destruction.



        7. To assess the effect of exenatide to improve islet graft function and survival in

           subjects that have returned to using exogenous insulin.



        8. To assess the ability of exenatide to improve islet survival at time of

           transplantation.

    <detailed_description>

      This Phase II trial will have 3 groups: Group A will receive islets from 2 donors and will

      not receive infliximab. Group B will receive, in addition to Daclizumab, Sirolimus, and

      Tacrolimus, a dose of infliximab and islets from a single donor, as per the Edmonton

      protocol. Everything else about the clinical trial will be the same for both groups. The

      first 4 patients will be assigned to Group A, the next 4 patients to Group B, the next 4

      patients to Group A, and the next 4 patients to Group B (total =16). Patients in Group A

      will receive 1-2 transplants with cells from 2 donors. If the second donor pancreas is

      received and satisfactory at the same time as the first pancreas, one islet infusion will be

      used to infuse cells from both donors. If the second pancreas is not received until after

      the first transplantation, a second islet infusion will be done. A second course of five

      doses of Daclizumab will be started on the day of the second islet infusion).



      In order to determine if prolonged administration of etanercept, in combination with

      transplantation of cultured islets, will prevent TNF-α production and enhance engraftment,

      we have added Group C to the current protocol. Group C, in addition to Daclizumab,

      Sirolimus, and Tacrolimus, will receive Etanercept in the peri-transplant period and islets

      from one or more donors. The last 24 patients included in this Protocol will be in Group C

      if they are new, or in Group A and B Supplemental Infusion if they had previous transplants.

      Any Group A or B participants who are eligible for a supplemental infusion will receive

      etanercept but no infliximab.

      This is a single-center, prospective, open label study in islet transplant recipients

      following islet graft loss.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      After complete islet graft loss is determined, patient's maintenance immunosuppression (i.e.

      sirolimus, tacrolimus, MMF and/or Myfortic®) will be discontinued and they will be monitored

      for 10 years thereafter, for the appearance of allosensitization using panel reactive

      antibody (PRA) levels and monitor the persistence of elevated PRA levels. Primary objective

      is to determine the rate of allosensitization in patients 3 years after failed islet

      transplantation (i.e. stimulated c-peptide &lt;0.3mg/mL) and monitor the persistence of

      elevated PRA levels (≥ 20%) at year 3, 6, and 9. Timing, frequency and level of change in

      PRA will be monitored after all immunosuppression is discontinued.

      This research trial studies neuropsychological (learning, remembering or thinking) and

      behavioral testing in younger patients with cancer. Collecting information over time from a

      series of tests may help doctors develop effective tests to measure neuropsychological and

      behavioral function of patients with cancer.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      I. To utilize a standardized battery of age-appropriate neuropsychological and behavioral

      tests in conjunction with Children's Oncology Group (COG) Phase III clinical trials to

      evaluate cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral functioning over time.



      II. To institute procedures to ensure a consistent, streamlined, and efficient

      administration of the neuropsychological/behavioral tests in a cooperative group setting in

      order to maximize compliance with a standardized assessment battery conducted at 3

      standardized timepoints.



      OUTLINE:



      Parent and child participants complete the COG Standard Neuropsychological and Behavioral

      Battery testing at 9, 30, and 60 months post-diagnosis in a 1-hour session conducted by a

      neuropsychologist or psychologist. The Battery consists of tests of intelligence, processing

      speed/attention, memory, language preference, general developmental progress, attention and

      behavior/social/emotional function, executive function, adoptive function, and quality of

      life. Additionally, parents complete a parent-report questionnaire to gather information

      about patient's function in terms of attention, memory, executive abilities, and behavioral,

      social, and emotional adaption.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to study how changes in the body during pregnancy influence the

      blood levels of TMC114 (darunavir) and ritonavir taken together, darunavir and cobicistat

      taken as a fixed-dose combination, TMC125 (etravirine) taken alone or with darunavir and

      ritonavir or rilpivirine in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). This study

      will examine how these drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the

      body and how they are removed from the body over time. Any pregnant woman who is currently

      receiving darunavir with ritonavir, darunavir with cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine for

      HIV-1, and who meets the eligibility criteria for the study, will be allowed to enroll.

      Patients must be willing to remain on study medication during the course of their pregnancy,

      and 12 weeks postpartum. The information collected may help answer questions about how to

      best prescribe these three drugs for pregnant women.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      There are many biological changes that occur during pregnancy, some of which may affect the

      way HIV medications are absorbed, distributed and removed within the body. Some medications

      have been used for HIV treatment during pregnancy, but little is known about how pregnancy

      affects the class of drugs being used in this study. To participate in this study, patients

      must be receiving 600mg of TMC114 (darunavir) taken with 100mg ritonavir twice daily or

      800mg of TMC114 (darunavir) with 100mg of ritonavir once daily or 800 mg of darunavir taken

      with 150mg of cobicistat taken once daily or 200mg of TMC125 (etravirine) (with or without

      darunavir/ ritonavir) taken twice daily or 25mg of TMC278 (rilpivirine) taken once daily

      plus additional antiretroviral drugs needed to construct an active antiretroviral regimen.

      Darunavir and ritonavir, darunavir and cobicistat, etravirine, or rilpivirine will be

      supplied to study participants. Darunavir and ritonavir are human immunodeficiency virus

      (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs); cobicistat is a pharmacoenhancer which boosts the levels of

      darunavir but has no anti-HIV activity; etravirine and rilpivirine are non-nucleoside

      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV. Twelve-hour or twenty four-hour blood

      sampling will be done for each patient at each of three study visits: Visit 4 (2nd

      trimester), Visit 5 (3rd trimester), and Visit 8 (6-12 weeks postpartum). Eight blood draws

      will be taken during each visit: One prior to intake of study medication, and one for each

      of seven post-dose sampling time-points (hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12). The study is

      designed primarily to examine the pharmacokinetics of darunavir/ritonavir (darunavir/r),

      darunavir/ cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine during the second and third trimesters of

      gestation, as well as postpartum. Pharmacokinetics measures how the body absorbs,

      distributes and excretes medication. The study will also examine any changes in anti-viral

      activity during pregnancy, and the postpartum period. It will note any safety and

      tolerability of the medications used by the mother, and will measure the level of

      darunavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine in the newborn's cord

      blood at the time of delivery; outcomes for both mother and child will be assessed as well.

      During the treatment period, patients will be seen at regular visits in the clinic, where

      the investigator will assess the patient's medical condition, any Adverse Events and study

      drug compliance. Laboratory evaluations for efficacy and safety will be done at regular

      visits as well as blood pressure monitoring. Up to forty-eight (48) HIV positive pregnant

      women will participate in this study. Study enrollment will be closed once 12 evaluable

      patients taking darunavir/ritonavir once daily, 12 evaluable patients taking

      darunavir/cobicistat once daily, 12 evaluable patients taking darunavir/ritonavir twice

      daily, 12 evaluable patients taking etravirine taking twice daily and 12 evaluable patients

      taking rilpivirine once daily have been enrolled. The study will be conducted at

      approximately 14 research centers in the United States and 1 in Puerto Rico. In order to

      participate, patients must be pregnant for 13-24 weeks. The primary purpose (or outcome) of

      the study is to assess the influence of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of

      darunavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine during the second and

      third trimesters of gestation, as well as postpartum. Darunavir: One 600 mg or two 300 mg

      tablets taken twice daily by mouth (two or four tablets a day total). Ritonavir: 100mg

      tablet taken twice daily by mouth (two tablets a day total), together with darunavir.

      Darunavir: Two 400 mg tablets taken once daily by mouth (two tablets a day total).

      Ritonavir: 100mg tablet taken once daily by mouth (one tablet a day total), together with

      darunavir. Darunavir/ cobicistat: a fixed dose combination containing 800mg of darunavir and

      150mg of cobicistat. Etravirine: Two 100 mg tablets taken twice daily by mouth (four tablets

      a day total). Rilpivirine: One 25mg tablet taken once daily by mouth (one tablet a day

      total). Study medication will be given from the baseline visit (second pregnancy trimester)

      until Visit 8 (up to 12 weeks after delivery).

    <brief_summary>

      This study will determine the clinical effectiveness, moderators and mechanisms of change,

      and economic impact of an integrative, family-based intervention that concurrently targets

      change in HIV/Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)-associated risk behaviors, drug abuse,

      delinquency, arrest and mental health outcomes for juvenile offenders committed to a

      juvenile justice day treatment program.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Adolescents committed to three school-based day treatment programs located in Miami-Dade

      County will be randomized to either Day Treatment MDFT-HIV (DT-MDFT-HIV) or Day Treatment

      Program Services as Usual (DT-SAU). Youth in both conditions will be enrolled in day

      treatment, and receive the same type of juvenile justice supervision, participate in the

      same educational, life skills, vocational and recreational programs. They will only differ

      in the type of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention services received, DT-MDFT-HIV

      versus substance abuse and HIV prevention services currently being provided by the day

      treatment programs. If participants are eligible, they will then be assessed on multiple

      measures at 5 time points: intake, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following commitment to the day

      treatment facility. Data will be analyzed using an intent-to-treat design - adolescents and

      one parent are assessed at all time points and included in data analyses, regardless of the

      amount of treatment received.



      The study has three aims:



      Aim 1: Intervention Effectiveness - To experimentally compare, in a day treatment setting,

      the short and long-term clinical outcomes of the Experimental Intervention - MDFT-HIV

      Integrated intervention (DT-MDFT-HIV) for sexually active drug abusing juvenile offenders

      with Day Treatment Services as Usual (DT-SAU).



      Hypothesis 1a. Youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV will show a greater decrease in HIV-associated

      sexual risk behaviors, laboratory-confirmed STD incidence, drug use, arrests and out of home

      placements, and mental health symptoms from baseline assessment through 6 months

      post-baseline than youths in SAU.



      Hypothesis 1b. Youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV will show a greater decrease in HIV-associated

      sexual risk behaviors, laboratory-confirmed STD incidence, drug use, arrests and out of home

      placements, and mental health symptoms from 6 months post baseline to 24 months

      post-baseline than youths in SAU.



      Hypothesis 1c. Youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV will be more likely to successfully transition

      out of the juvenile justice day treatment program--and return to regular school

      placement--than those assigned to services as usual.



      Aim 2: Moderating Effects - To identify baseline client characteristics that moderate

      intervention outcomes.



      Hypothesis 2. For youths with high baseline levels of co-morbidity, HIV-associated sexual

      risk behaviors, drug use and delinquency, the DT-MDFT-HIV intervention will reduce

      HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors and laboratory-confirmed STD incidence, drug use, and

      arrests and out of home placements more significantly than the DT-SAU condition. For youths

      with low baseline levels of HIV-associated sexual risk behaviors, drug use and delinquency,

      the two interventions will be comparably effective.



      Aim 3: Mechanisms of Action - To identify the mechanisms through which the experimental

      intervention achieves its effects.



      Hypothesis 3a. For youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV, reductions in HIV-associated sexual risk

      behaviors and laboratory-confirmed STD incidence will be achieved through (a) increases in

      HIV/STD knowledge and risk-reduction skills, (b) enhanced self-efficacy regarding condom

      use, (c) improved communication and refusal skills with partners, (d) greater perceived peer

      norms supportive of safer sex, (e) open communication with parents about HIV and sexual risk

      behaviors, and (f) more effective parenting and improved family functioning.



      Hypothesis 3b. For youths assigned to DT-MDFT-HIV, reductions in drug use and delinquency

      will be achieved through (a) increases in adolescents' bonding to prosocial peers and

      activities (e.g. school), (b) increases in parents' emotional bonding to their adolescent,

      and improvements in parenting practices, and (c) more positive family environment.

    <brief_summary>

      The investigators are collecting blood samples to learn more about how the body's immune

      system recovers after stem cell transplant (SCT). Participants are either previous

      recipients of a stem cell transplant, or a donor of stem cells for transplant.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The investigators propose to systematically collect specimens of blood and plasma from

      donors and recipients of SCT. For recipients, samples may be collected at the following time

      points or transplant milestones. If the recipient is not able to be present at SCCC/UMHC

      during the window of one of these milestone visits, the specified collection may be missed

      due to unavailability. The recipient may then resume sample collection at the subsequent

      collection period. Collections may be received within 30 days prior to transplantation, at

      approximately 30 days (+/- 7 business days), 60 days (+/- 14 business days), 100 days (+/-

      21 business days), six months (+/- 21 business days), one year(+/- 21 business days), and

      annually(+/- 21 business days) thereafter following SCT. Up to three additional samples,

      collected no more frequently than weekly, may be collected if recipients experience

      complications (e.g., viral reactivation) associated with abnormal T cell immune recovery

      after SCT. A sample may also be removed that is equal to or less than 1% of the total

      product volume of the donor collection, prior to recipient infusion. For donors, one sample

      will be collected prior to stem cell mobilization with G-CSF.



      Assays to be performed may include the following: 1) Functional studies of antigen-specific

      T cell responses to pathogens (e.g., cytomegalovirus) and to other antigens (e.g., to

      defined epitopes that have been identified as potential malignancy-specific targets)(8,15);

      2) T cell immunophenotyping (to define the recovery of T cell subsets associated with a

      "naive" or "memory" T cell phenotype)(16,17); 3) Studies examining the molecular diversity

      of the T cell repertoire(18,19); 4) Studies to identify recent thymic emigrants in the

      peripheral blood to determine the extent of thymic function occurring at steady state or

      following BMT(11,20); and 5) Assays of plasma levels of cytokines (e.g., interleukin-7) that

      may be important in T cell reconstitution(21,22). Some or all of these studies may be

      performed at the time of collection. In most cases, cryopreserved PBMC or plasma samples

      will be used for these assays. Cryopreserved cells in excess of requirements for studies of

      immune reconstitution will be banked to allow access by other investigators to these

      specimens.



      By increasing our understanding of immune recovery post-stem cell transplantation, the

      investigators will be able to develop strategies to improve immune recovery and reduce

      graft-versus-host disease to be tested in future clinical trials. It is the investigators'

      goal to develop graft engineering strategies to improve both of those important clinical

      problems in SCT patients.



      The purpose of this protocol is to study immune reconstitution and graft-versus- host

      disease in stem cell transplant recipients, and to study the role of donor cells and the

      clinical regimen on those processes.

    <brief_summary>

      Overall rationale: Prophylactic NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and

      immediate reconstruction for patient with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer

      will allow better cosmesis and patient's satisfaction.



      Study design: Phase I trial assessing the safety, feasibility and toxicity of prophylactic

      NAC irradiation after nipple-areola sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction in

      patients with ductal carcinoma in-situ or invasive breast cancer.



      Primary objective: To determine the recommended phase I dose of post-operative prophylactic

      NAC irradiation.



      Secondary objectives: To provide extensive descriptive data regarding NAC-sparing surgery

      with reconstruction, including both surgeon experience and patient evaluation of cosmetic

      results. Survival and recurrence will be assessed.



      Study size: Between 12 and 18 patients will be enrolled in this phase I study.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      -  The use of NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC (nipple-areola complex)

           external beam radiotherapy for selected patient with early stage invasive or in-situ

           breast cancers will be technically feasible and with acceptable complication rates.



        -  The cosmetic results after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative external

           beam radiotherapy to the NAC will be better comparable with Skin Sparing Mastectomy.



        -  The local control rate in the NAC will be more than expected for a NAC sparing

           mastectomy without postoperative radiotherapy.



        -  The patient's satisfaction after NAC-sparing mastectomy followed by postoperative NAC

           external beam radiotherapy will be better than after Skin Sparing Mastectomy.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to collect and study clinical and laboratory information about

      a pregnant or new mother and her medical care that will increase our knowledge of the best

      care for HIV-infected pregnant women and their children.



      The rate of transmission of HIV from mothers to their infants has gone down. Specific U.S.

      Public Health Service guidelines recommend that HIV-infected pregnant women be treated with

      anti-HIV therapies; but the effectiveness of treatment and safety for the mother and her

      infant have not been fully examined. This study will monitor the health of women and their

      infants while they receive anti-HIV therapy. Also, this study will provide information that

      may be used for future studies.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The current low rate of vertical transmission of HIV in the U.S. limits the number and types

      of questions concerning transmission risk and pathogenesis that can be addressed by a single

      clinical trial. Specific U.S. Public Health Service guidelines recommend antiretroviral

      therapy (ART) during pregnancy to maximize health of women. However, data regarding the

      effectiveness and safety of and adherence to ART during pregnancy are limited. It is both

      appropriate and necessary for theInternational Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical

      Trials Group (IMPAACT) to recruit pregnant women into a non-interventional, analytic,

      epidemiologic study to methodically collect clinical and laboratory data from them and their

      infants. This way, the IMPAACT can achieve the aims of evaluating management of HIV-infected

      women during pregnancy and determining the safety and effectiveness of ART and other

      interventions intended to prevent vertical transmission and/or improve maternal health. In

      addition, longitudinally collected core protocol data and repository specimens will enable

      future substudies.



      Participants receive no protocol specific treatment or other intervention as part of this

      study. The study involves the follow-up of HIV-infected women enrolled during pregnancy or

      at the time of delivery for 6 months postpartum and their infants for the first 6 months of

      life. There will be 8 study visits for enrolled participants and 6 study visits for infants.

      Data concerning ART use, adherence to medications, and review of symptoms relevant to side

      effects and toxicities are collected through administration of questionnaires at all

      maternal visits. Phlebotomy is conducted to obtain specimens for a repository and for

      required laboratory tests. During labor and delivery, maternal blood is obtained for

      lymphocyte subset and viral load assays and for repository storage. Collection of amniotic

      fluid at the time of cesarean section is encouraged. These collections are submitted to a

      central repository. Data for the core protocol are abstracted from the infant's medical

      record at the time of birth and at each postnatal visit.

      This research trial studies biomarkers in tumor tissue samples from patients with newly

      diagnosed neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue from

      patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about

      biomarkers related to cancer.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To prospectively analyze the factors that are currently used for risk-group assignment

      (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog [MYCN] copy

      number by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH], deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] content by

      flow cytometry, and tumor histology using the International Neuroblastoma Pathologic

      Classification System) in neuroblastoma tumors at the time of diagnosis.



      II. To maintain a reference bank containing clinically and genetically characterized frozen

      tumor tissue, tumor DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA), histology slides and paraffin blocks,

      neuroblastoma-derived cell lines, patient serum and paired normal DNA obtained at the time

      of diagnosis, at the time of second-look surgery and at the time of relapse for future

      research studies.



      III. To prospectively analyze 1p, 11q, 14q and 17q allelic status, MYCN copy number by

      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and the expression pattern of

      neurotrophin-related genes in diagnostic neuroblastoma tumors, and assay for the presence of

      rare tumor cells in biological specimens by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR; these biological

      variables will be analyzed for independent clinical significance compared to MYCN

      amplification, International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) stage, age, ploidy, and

      histologic variables in predicting either response to treatment or outcome.



      IV. To build a database of the known biologic prognostic factors for patients on therapeutic

      studies.



      V. To serve as a Registry for neuroblastoma patients whose tumors demonstrate clinical and

      genetic features defined as "Low Risk" for treatment failure in the absence of adjuvant

      therapy.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To prospectively analyze the concordance between detection of MYCN amplification in tumor

      samples and quantitative detection of MYCN DNA in serum, and to analyze the prognostic

      significance of MYCN amplification as detected in serum samples.



      II. To build a database that includes information regarding the presentation and natural

      history of neuroblastoma-associated health problems including but not limited to opsoclonus

      myoclonus ataxia (OMA) and/or spinal cord compression.



      OUTLINE:



      Patients undergo collection of blood, tissue, and bone marrow samples for analysis via

      RT-PCR, quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, and FISH.



      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.

    <eligibility>

        Inclusion Criteria:



          -  All newly diagnosed patients with suspected neuroblastoma, suspected

             ganglioneuroblastoma, or suspected ganglioneuroma/maturing subtype seen at Children's

             Oncology Group (COG) institutions are eligible for this study



               -  There will be no penalty under any circumstances for enrollment of a patient

                  whose definitive institutional diagnosis, or central review diagnosis, is found

                  to be a tumor other than neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma/

                  maturing subtype



          -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy prior to enrollment on ANBL00B1 and

             procurement of study-related tissues with the following exception:



               -  Patients that in the opinion of the treating physician are too ill to undergo

                  pre-treatment tissue biopsy and require EMERGENT chemotherapy may be enrolled on

                  ANBL00B1; documentation of the emergent nature of therapy initiation is required



          -  It is required that a good faith effort (documented by specimen tracking) be made to

             submit a neuroblastoma sample (tumor, metastasis, and/or tumor-involved bone marrow)

             of sufficient quality for MYCN analysis in the Neuroblastoma Reference Laboratory in

             order for any newly diagnosed patient to be enrolled on ANBL00B1; this should be

             obtained prior to initiation of therapy



          -  Exceptions



               -  In rare cases, patients may be deemed too ill to undergo pre-treatment tissue

                  biopsy and require EMERGENT therapy; the following eligibility guidelines apply

                  to these cases:



                    -  For presumed INSS stage 4S patients: Efforts to submit tumor tissue (e.g.,

                       primary tumor, skin nodule, or metastatic site) within 96 hours of EMERGENT

                       therapy initiation should be made; however, if the child is deemed too

                       unstable for such a procedure they may still be enrolled as long as

                       pre-treatment peripheral blood and serum have been submitted



                    -  For all other INSS stages: tumor tissue should be obtained as soon as

                       possible within 96 hours of EMERGENT therapy initiation; patients without

                       tumor tissues submitted within this time-frame are not eligible for

                       enrollment



                         -  Note: it may not be possible to obtain all necessary tumor biomarkers

                            for therapy stratification in such cases; if a patient enrolled on

                            ANBL00B1 undergoes an additional diagnostic procedure within 96 hours

                            of initiating therapy, additional tumor specimens may be submitted to

                            obtain biomarkers used for risk classification; the decision to

                            perform such procedures, and/or submit these specimens, is to be made

                            by the managing clinicians and should reflect the clinical need to

                            know the status of such biomarkers



                    -  Patients enrolled on ANBL1232 in Group A (either A1 or A2) will not have a

                       tumor biopsy or resection upfront; tumor tissue submission is therefore not

                       required for these patients to enroll on ANBL00B1; a peripheral blood and

                       serum sample is the only specimen required to be submitted for this group

                       of patients; should they undergo a biopsy or resection at a later date

                       tumor can be submitted for biomarker testing at this time



          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed

             consent



          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute

             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met



        Exclusion Criteria:



          -  Patients with relapsed neuroblastoma who were not enrolled on ANBL00B1 at original

    <brief_summary>

      The BABY HUG Treatment Study was designed to see if treatment with the drug hydroxyurea

      (also called HU) in children with sickle cell disease could prevent organ damage, especially

      in the spleen and kidneys. There was also a chance that treatment could prevent painful

      crises, lung disease, stroke, and blood infection.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The current observational trial, Follow-Up Study II (designated FUS II) includes enhanced

      neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations for this very well

      characterized cohort of subjects. Measures of spleen and renal function and markers of DNA

      damage will continue to be collected. Assessment of other target organs in sickle cell

      disease including pulmonary and cardiac function will be performed in addition to evaluation

      of developmental aspects of SCD and potential HU toxicity.

      This study is a randomized strategy trial conducted among women who received highly active

      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during pregnancy for purposes of prevention of

      mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV but do not otherwise meet criteria to initiate

      HAART for their own health. The study is designed to determine whether continuation of HAART

      after delivery or other pregnancy outcome reduces morbidity and mortality compared to

      discontinuation and re-initiation of HAART according to current standards of care.

      RATIONALE: Giving radiation therapy that uses a 3-dimensional (3-D) image of the tumor to

      help focus thin beams of radiation directly on the tumor, and giving radiation therapy in

      higher doses over a shorter period of time, may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side

      effects. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways.

      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help

      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether radiation

      therapy is more effective when given alone or together with cetuximab in treating patients

      with head and neck cancer that has been removed by surgery.



      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it

      works compared with radiation therapy given together with cetuximab in treating patients who

      have undergone surgery for locally advanced head and neck cancer.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        -  Determine whether the addition of cetuximab to postoperative intensity-modulated

           radiotherapy (IMRT) will improve overall survival (OS) in patients with locally

           advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck at intermediate risk following

           surgery.



      Secondary



        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on disease-free

           survival (DFS) of these patients.



        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on acute and late

           dysphagia, xerostomia, skin toxicity, and other toxicities according to common Toxicity

           Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE), v. 4 and their relationships with

           patient-reported outcomes at 3, 12, and 24 months.



        -  Analyze tumor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), specifically the extent of

           EGFR overexpression by immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and FISH analysis, EGFRvIII

           expression, as well as the association of these assay data with OS and DFS.



        -  Analyze tumor for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (as defined by in situ

           hybridization), specifically, within the cohort of patients with oropharynx cancer, to

           perform an exploratory analysis of the impact of HPV on DFS and OS of this patient

           subset.



        -  Analyze tumor DNA for TP53 mutations as a predictor of response to cetuximab and

           prognosis.



        -  Analyze germline DNA of polymorphic variants in EGFR intron repeats as a predictor of

           response to cetuximab.



      Tertiary



        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on loco-regional

           control.



        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on

           patient-reported quality of life, swallowing, xerostomia, and skin toxicity based on

           head and neck specific instruments, including the Performance Status Scale for Head and

           Neck Cancer (PSS-HN), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head &amp; Neck

           (FACT-H&amp;N), the University of Michigan Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale

           (XeQOLS), and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).



        -  Assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab to postoperative IMRT on cost-utility

           analysis using the EuroQol (EQ-5D).



        -  Evaluate the utility of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) as a means of enhancing the

           efficacy (i.e., loco-regional control) of IMRT while reducing the acute and/or late

           toxicity (particularly xerostomia) and improving patient-reported outcomes

           (particularly XeQOLS scores).



        -  Retrospectively compare the loco-regional control rate in patients treated with IMRT

           alone (no IGRT or cetuximab) with similar patients treated with external beam

           radiotherapy alone in the postoperative clinical trial Radiation Therapy Oncology Group

           (RTOG)-95 01.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to clinical stage

      (T2-3 vs T4a), EGFR expression (high [≥ 80% of cells staining positive] vs low [&lt; 80% of

      cells staining positive] vs not evaluable), primary site of disease (oral cavity vs larynx

      vs oropharynx p16+ vs oropharynx p16- vs oropharynx, p16 not evaluable), and use of

      image-guided radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



        -  Arm I: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily 5 days a

           week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



        -  Arm II: Patients undergo IMRT as in arm I. Patients also receive cetuximab IV over 1-2

           hours once weekly beginning at least 5 days prior to the start of IMRT and continuing

           for 4 weeks after the completion of IMRT (for a total of 11 doses) in the absence of

           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 12, and 24 months.



      Tissue samples are collected periodically for further laboratory analysis.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, every 3

      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <brief_summary>

      Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also called pseudotumor cerebri, is a disorder

      of elevated intracranial pressure of unknown cause [Corbett, et al., 1982; Wall, et al.,

      1991]. Its incidence is 22.5 new cases each year per 100,000 overweight women of

      childbearing age, and is rising [Garrett, et al., 2004] in parallel with the obesity

      epidemic. It affects about 100,000 Americans. Most patients suffer debilitating headaches.

      Because of pressure on the optic nerve (papilledema), 86% have some degree of permanent

      visual loss and 10% develop severe visual loss [Wall, et al., 1991]. Interventions to

      prevent loss of sight, all with unproven efficacy, include diet, diuretics such as

      acetazolamide, repeated spinal taps, optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery, and

      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures. The purported goal of these therapies is to

      lower intracranial pressure; however, it is unclear which treatments work and by what

      mechanism. None of these strategies has been verified by properly designed clinical trials.

      Thus, there is confusion, uncertainty, and weak scientific rationales to guide treatment

      decisions. This trial will study subjects who have mild visual loss from IIH to (1)

      establish convincing, evidence-based treatment strategies for IIH to restore and protect

      vision, (2) follow subjects up to 4 years to observe the long-term treatment outcomes and

      (3) determine the cause of IIH. To meet those aims, the trial will be divided into a

      12-month intervention phase and a 3-year observational phase. Subjects are not required to

      complete the observational phase of the study, but will be asked to do so and consented for

      the observational phase of the study at the conclusion of the intervention phase (12

      months).

    <detailed_description>

      Clinical Phase: Phase II Investigators: NORDIC Network sites Study Centers: 38 study centers

      Coordinating Center - University of Rochester Statistical Center - University of Rochester

      Study Period Planned enrollment duration: 2 years Planned duration of treatment: 6 months

      followed by open-label treatment Planned duration of follow-up: 4.5 years Study Objectives:

      The primary objective is determining the efficacy of diet plus acetazolamide vs diet alone

      in reducing or reversing visual loss in subjects with mild visual loss.



      The secondary objective is to identify proteomic and genetic risk factors for IIH by

      screening a large cohort of IIH patients and controls.



      Study Population This project will enroll 166 individuals with IIH who are 18-60 years of

      age. We anticipate that the population will be primarily composed of women in the

      childbearing years that are overweight. 154 control subjects will also be enrolled. Control

      subjects will be matched as closely as possibly by age, sex, race, ethnicity and weight to

      subjects enrolled at the site.



      Study Design: Multi-center, double-blind randomized intervention study followed by a 4-year

      observation period. Subjects will be randomized to diet and acetazolamide or diet and

      placebo. The study will use 250 mg acetazolamide or matching placebo tablets taken with food

      at meals and at bedtime. The subject will begin with one tablet four times daily, at meals

      and at bedtime for the first week. Beginning on Day 7, subjects will increase the dosage by

      1 tablet every 4 days until a final dosage of 4 tablets four times daily (4 grams) is

      reached or side effects prohibit increasing the dosage further. If the study drug is not

      tolerated at a dose of 250 mg, then 125 mg (1/2 tablet) will be tried. If this is not

      tolerated, no pharmacologic treatment will be given.



      After the 6 month visit, all subjects will transition from study medication to acetazolamide

      (open label) by replacing one tablet of study drug with 250 mg of acetazolamide every four

      days. The acetazolamide dose will be titrated in a manner similar to the initial study drug

      schedule to the maximum tolerated dose of acetazolamide. To avoid treating subjects (who may

      have initially been assigned to placebo) unnecessarily, any subject with grade 0-1

      papilledema will be tapered off study drug but not placed on acetazolamide unless they have

      persisting headaches or pulse-synchronous tinnitus. If so, they will be placed on

      acetazolamide regardless of the low papilledema grade. At the 9-month follow-up visit, we

      will make sure that the subjects' vision is stable after the transition off of study

      medication. After the 9 month visit, medication will be prescribed by the subject's treating

      physician. The intervention phase of the study will end at the subject's 12 month visit and

      subjects will be invited to participate in the observational phase of the study and

      consented to do so if willing.

    <brief_summary>

      Propanolol is a beta blocker which has been found to inhibit the ability of epinephrine to

      upregulate sickle red cell adhesion to laminin and endothelial cells in vitro. The purpose

      of this pilot study is to administer one dose of propanolol to children with sickle cell

      disease and to measure pre and post dose red cell adhesion. The hypothesis is that a single

      dose of propanolol will decrease red cell adhesion to laminin and endothelial cells as

      compared to baseline.

    <detailed_description>

      A similar pilot study has already been conducted in adults and is now being tried in

      children to gather preliminary data for a grant submission. No safety issues were found in

      the adult pilot study. This study will evaluate the effect of different doses of propanolol.

      The risks of this study involve the risks of three (3) blood draws and the risks of

      propanolol. In order to minimize the risks children with sickle cell disease and asthma will

      be excluded because asthma is a contraindication to the use of propanolol. In addition,

      patients will not be hypertensive or bradycardic.

    <brief_summary>

      The focus of this study will be to test the Familias Unidas Intervention program among

      Hispanic 8th graders in the Miami-Dade County Public School System. This study will

      contribute to the advancement of knowledge in both the scientific community and the Hispanic

      population in Miami-Dade County. It will shed light on whether and to what extent Familias

      Unidas is effective in preventing drug use and unsafe sexual behavior in Hispanic

      adolescents. To the scientific community, the investigators will disseminate our findings

      via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings.



      The design for the proposed study is a randomized controlled trial. This design is

      considered the "gold standard" design when evaluating the efficacy of two (or more)

      treatment conditions. Participants for this study will be 744 Hispanic 8th grade adolescents

      and their parents recruited from 24 randomly selected middle schools in Miami Dade County

      that meet the school inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 12 schools (for a total of 372

      Hispanic adolescents and their parents) will be randomized to Familias Unidas and a total of

      12 schools (for a total of 372 Hispanic adolescents and their parents) will be randomized to

      the Community Practice.

    <detailed_description>

      Substance use (including cigarette and illicit drug use) and HIV represent major public

      health problems facing America's youth (CDC, 2007; Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, &amp;

      Schulenberg, 2007). Hispanic adolescents report higher use across all drug categories (with

      the exception of amphetamines) and higher cigarette use than non-Hispanic White and African

      American adolescents (Johnston et al., 2007). Hispanic youth also engage in higher rates of

      unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse than non-Hispanic White and African

      American adolescents (CDC, 2007). Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics are also

      disproportionately represented among HIV/AIDS cases, accounting for 18% if all such cases in

      the United States (CDC, 2006). These disparities are especially disconcerting because

      Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority group in the United States (Marotta &amp;

      Garcia, 2003). Preventing substance use and HIV in Hispanic adolescents is therefore if

      vital importance.



      Familias Unidas is delivered through family-centered, multi-parent groups that place parents

      in the change agent role and through family visits. Each parenting skill is discussed and

      role-played in parent-group sessions and is then enacted with the parent and the adolescent

      in a family visit. During the group sessions, the facilitator offers support for parents and

      gently corrects maladaptive interactions between parents and adolescents (during the

      group-session role plays, the role of adolescent is played by another parent). During family

      visits, facilitators assist families in practicing skills and restructuring family

      interactions. The parent group sessions focus on parental investment in the adolescent's

      worlds (e.g., peer and school worlds), family communication, family support, behavior

      management/positive parenting, parental monitoring, adolescent substance use, and adolescent

      unsafe sex and HIV. Consistent with our prior Familias Unidas efficacy studies, all parent

      group sessions and all family visits will be conducted in Spanish and will take place in the

      evenings and on Saturdays at the school or at a community site that is preferred by the

      families.



      The proposed study will be guided by four aims. AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of

      Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in

      preventing illicit drug use in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents; AIM 2 is to

      evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice in preventing

      cigarette use in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents; AIM 3 is to evaluate the

      effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice, in preventing unsafe

      sexual behavior in a community sample of Hispanic adolescents; and AIM 4 is to assess the

      extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug

      use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior.



      Hypothesis 1. Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing

      adolescent illicit drug use (defined as frequency of illicit drug use in the past 90 days)

      over time.



      Hypothesis 1a. The effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated

      by improvements in family functioning, defined as parental involvement, parental monitoring

      of peers, parent-adolescent communication, social support, and positive parenting.



      Hypothesis 2. Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing

      cigarette use (defined as frequency of cigarette use in the past 90 days) over time.



      Hypothesis 2a. The effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by

      improvements in family functioning, defined as parental involvement, parental monitoring of

      peers, parent-adolescent communication, family support, and positive parenting.



      Hypothesis 3. Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing

      unsafe sexual behavior (defined as unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse)

      over time.



      Hypothesis 3a. The effect of Familias Unidas on unsafe sexual behavior will be partially

      mediated by improvement in family functioning, defined as parental involvement, parental

      monitoring of peers, parent-adolescent communication, family support, and positive

      parenting.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Valiant stent graft is safe and effective

      in treating patients who have a blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). BTAI is when the aorta

      has been injured due to traumatic force to the chest area. It is commonly caused by motor

      vehicle accidents. In most cases it is life threatening and the standard treatment is

      surgery. Many times when a person has a BTAI they also have other injuries that can affect

      the results of the surgery.



      Since stent grafting has been an effective way to treat other aortic conditions such as

      aneurysms (bulge in aorta wall), it is believed that the Valiant stent graft would be

      effective in treating BTAI. A stent graft is a woven polyester tube (graft) supported by a

      metal frame of strong but flexible nitinol (type of metal) springs (stent) that is placed in

      the aorta to help seal the injury and keep it from bleeding.

      This phase III trial studies the side effects and how well risk-based therapy works in

      treating younger patients with newly diagnosed liver cancer. Surgery, chemotherapy drugs

      (cancer fighting medicines), and when necessary, liver transplant, are the main current

      treatments for hepatoblastoma. The stage of the cancer is one factor used to decide the best

      treatment. Treating patients according to the risk group they are in may help get rid of the

      cancer, keep it from coming back, and decrease the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) in children with stage I (non-pure fetal

      histology [PFH], non-small cell undifferentiated [SCU]) and stage II (non-SCU)

      hepatoblastoma treated with surgical resection followed by 2 cycles of cisplatin,

      fluorouracil, and vincristine sulfate (C5V).



      II. To determine the feasibility and toxicity of adding doxorubicin (doxorubicin

      hydrochloride) to the chemotherapy regimen of C5V for children with intermediate-risk

      hepatoblastoma.



      III. To estimate the response rate to vincristine (vincristine sulfate), irinotecan

      (irinotecan hydrochloride), and temsirolimus in previously untreated children with

      high-risk, metastatic hepatoblastoma.



      IV. To determine whether timely (between diagnosis and end of second cycle of chemotherapy)

      consultation with a treatment center with surgical expertise in major pediatric liver

      resection and transplant can be achieved in 70% of patients with potentially unresectable

      hepatoblastoma.



      V. To foster the collection of tumor tissue and biologic samples to facilitate translational

      research and to provide data that may aid in risk-adapted approaches for subsequent clinical

      trials.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate the EFS of patients with stage I PFH treated with surgery alone. II. To

      determine whether orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be accomplished after

      successful referral and completion of 4 cycles of initial chemotherapy.



      III. To estimate the 2-year EFS for patients once identified as candidates for possible OLT,

      the 2-year EFS for patients referred to a transplant center that are resected without OLT,

      and the 2-year EFS for patients referred to a transplant center who receive OLT.



      IV. To register children with hepatoblastoma who receive OLT with PLUTO (Pediatric Liver

      Unresectable Tumor Observatory), an international cooperative registry for children

      transplanted for liver tumors.



      V. To determine if pretreatment extent of disease (PRETEXT) grouping can predict tumor

      resectability.



      VI. To monitor the concordance between institutional assessment of PRETEXT grouping and

      PRETEXT grouping as performed by expert panel review.



      VII. To estimate the proportion of stage IV patients who have surgical resection of

      metastatic pulmonary lesions.



      VIII. To determine the proportion and estimate the EFS of patients with potentially poor

      prognostic factors including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) &lt; 100 ng/mL at diagnosis, microscopic

      positive surgical margins, surgical complications, multifocal tumors, microscopic vascular

      invasion, macrotrabecular histologic subtype, and SCU histologic subtype.



      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups according to risk group.



      VERY LOW-RISK GROUP: Patients undergo surgery and receive no further treatment.



      LOW-RISK GROUP: (regimen T) Patients undergo surgery and then receive adjuvant cisplatin

      intravenously (IV) over 6 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV on day 2, and vincristine sulfate

      IV on days 2, 9, and 16. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of

      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      INTERMEDIATE-RISK GROUP: (regimen F) (closed to accrual as of 3/12/2012) Patients receive

      C5VD chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, fluorouracil IV on day 2,

      vincristine sulfate IV on days 2, 9, and 16, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15

      minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo surgical resection after course

      2 OR surgical resection or liver transplantation after course 4 of C5VD.



      HIGH-RISK GROUP: (regimen H) Patients receive up front VIT chemotherapy comprising

      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on

      days 1-5, and temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment with VIT repeats

      every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with disease response then receive 6 courses of C5VD with 4 courses of VIT in

      between each 2-course block. Patients with no disease response receive 6 courses of C5VD in

      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor

      resection or liver transplant after course 4 of C5VD followed by 2 courses of adjuvant C5VD.



      After completion of study therapy, patients who receive chemotherapy are followed up

      periodically for at least 4 years.

    <brief_summary>

      Elevated blood pressure (BP) is an important public health concern. It is highly prevalent,

      the prevalence may be increasing, and it is a risk factor for several adverse health

      outcomes, especially coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease,

      and decline in cognitive function. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)

      is a 2-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a treatment

      program aimed at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a lower goal than currently

      recommended will reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      SPRINT will randomize about 9250 participants aged ≥ 50 years with SBP ≥130 mm Hg and at

      least one additional CVD risk factor. The trial will compare the effects of randomization to

      a treatment program of an intensive SBP goal with randomization to a treatment program of a

      standard goal. Target SBP goals are &lt;120 vs &lt;140 mm Hg, respectively, to create a minimum

      mean difference of 10 mm Hg between the two randomized groups. The primary hypothesis is

      that CVD event rates will be lower in the intensive arm. Participants will be recruited at

      approximately 90 clinics within 5 clinical center networks (CCNs) over approximately a

      2-year period, and will be followed for 4-6 years.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work

      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by

      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.

      It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given

      with or without additional chemotherapy in treating cervical cancer.



      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemotherapy and pelvic radiation

      therapy to see how well they work when given with or without additional chemotherapy in

      treating patients with high-risk early-stage cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        -  To determine if administering adjuvant systemic chemotherapy after chemoradiotherapy

           will improve disease-free survival compared to chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with

           high-risk early-stage cervical carcinoma found to have positive nodes and/or positive

           parametria after radical hysterectomy.



      Secondary



        -  To evaluate adverse events.



        -  To evaluate overall survival.



        -  To evaluate quality of life.



        -  To evaluate chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.



        -  To perform a post-hoc dose-volume evaluation between patients treated with standard

           radiotherapy and patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with

           respect to toxicity and local control.



        -  To collect fixed tissue samples to identify tumor molecular signatures that may be

           associated with patient outcomes, such as adverse events, disease-free survival, and

           overall survival.



        -  To collect blood samples to identify secreted factors from serum and plasma that may be

           associated with adverse events or outcome and to identify single nucleotide

           polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from buffy coat that may be associated with a genetic

           predisposition to tumor formation itself or a response to cytotoxic therapy.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned use of

      brachytherapy (no vs. yes), radiotherapy modality - [standard external beam radiotherapy

      (EBRT) vs. intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)], and radiotherapy dose (45 Gy vs. 50.4

      Gy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard EBRT or IMRT to the pelvis once daily 5 days a week

           for 5-6 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly

           for 6 weeks.



      NOTE: Some patients may also undergo brachytherapy beginning within 7 days after completion

      of radiotherapy.



        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy as in arm I. Beginning 4-6 weeks after

           completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and

           carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses

           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      Quality of life is assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Gynecologic

      Oncology Group (FACT-GOG/NTX4), FACT-Cx, and FACIT-D questionnaires at baseline; at the

      completion of chemoradiotherapy; and then at 6, 12, and 24 months after completion of

      chemoradiotherapy.



      Blood and tissue samples may be collected for gene expression analysis by

      immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and for biomarker and polymorphism studies.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up very 3 months for 2 years,

      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <brief_summary>

      Cancer results when undifferentiated cells grow in an uncontrolled manner, crowding out

      normal cells, causing morbidity and ultimately mortality. The cancer stem cell theory

      suggests that most tumors undergo a process of differentiation through which a relatively

      rare cancer stem or progenitor cell (CSC) gives rise to more differentiated populations of

      cells (including transiently amplifying cells) comprising the bulk of the tumor. As a result

      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to

      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key

      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the

      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many

      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in

      CSC. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs

      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigators' research program focuses on

      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of

      small molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are

      fundamental to CSCs. Our preliminary results identified a novel Notch associated protein

      NACK that functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Notch. Moreover, Nack is expressed

      in human solid tumors and is required for cell survival and tumor growth in notch -dependent

      tumor cells. The investigators' aim is to further interrogate the link between Notch and

      Nack.

    <brief_summary>

      The investigators propose to study novel targets of rituximab in podocytes, with a

      particular focus on recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The proposed study

      has strong clinical implications, since it may extend the approved indications for rituximab

      treatment to recurrent FSGS as well as to other proteinuric diseases. Furthermore, it will

      offer new insights into the role of sphyngomyelin related enzymes in podocyte function in

      health and disease, thus allowing the identification of novel targets for antiproteinuric

      drug development. Finally, the proposed study offers the opportunity to identify a

      correlation between the patient's specific clinical outcome and the experimental results

      obtained after exposing podocytes to patient sera in the presence or absence of rituximab.

      Therefore, it may lead to the development of an assay for the pre-transplant identification

      of patients at high-risk for recurrent disease and, among them, may allow the identification

      of those patients that will respond to rituximab.

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill

      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells.

      Androgen-deprivation therapy may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. It is not

      yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without androgen-deprivation

      therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.



      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it

      works compared with radiation therapy given together with androgen-deprivation therapy in

      treating patients with prostate cancer.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        -  Demonstrate an overall survival (OS) advantage in patients with intermediate-risk

           prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated radiotherapy (RT) with versus without

           short-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).



      Secondary



        -  Determine whether the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT versus RT alone improves

           clinical failures, biochemical failure by the "nadir +2", freedom from failure, rate of

           salvage ADT, and prostate cancer-specific mortality in these patients.



        -  Estimate the magnitude of benefit of ADT with respect to OS in patients treated with

           different RT modalities (i.e., external-beam radiation therapy alone vs low-dose rate

           brachytherapy boost vs high-dose rate brachytherapy boost).



        -  Compare acute and late treatment adverse events of these regimens and correlate these

           events with the presence or absence of pre-existing comorbidity as documented by the

           Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 assessment.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of radiotherapy. Patients are

      stratified according to number of risk factors (1 vs 2-3), comorbidity (ACE-27 grade ≥ 2 vs

      &lt; 2), and radiotherapy (RT) modality (dose-escalated external-beam RT [EBRT] vs EBRT and

      low-dose rate brachytherapy boost vs EBRT and high-dose rate brachytherapy boost). Patients

      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



        -  Arm I: Patients undergo EBRT* once daily on days 1-5 for about 9 weeks (44 treatments).

           Some patients instead receive EBRT with high-dose rate or low-dose rate brachytherapy

           implant on days 1-5 for about 5 weeks (25 treatments). NOTE: *Type of RT is at

           discretion of treating physician and may include either 3D-conformal RT or

           intensity-modulated RT.



        -  Arm II: Patients receive androgen-deprivation therapy comprising luteinizing-hormone

           releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist (leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, or triptorelin)

           subcutaneously or as an injection every 1 to 3 months AND an oral antiandrogen therapy

           (flutamide 3 times daily or bicalutamide once daily) for 6 months. Beginning 8 weeks

           after the first LHRH injection, patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.



      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.

      This study will examine the long-term effects of HIV infection, highly active antiretroviral

      therapy (HAART), and experimental treatments on children who participated in PACTG 219C or

      select IMPAACT studies.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The use of HAART has been important in extending the lives of people with HIV infection.

      However, prolonged use of HAART may have long-term consequences. In addition, people

      participating in clinical trials using experimental therapies to treat HIV infection may

      experience negative health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify the long-term

      effects of HIV infection, HAART, and experimental treatments in infants, children, and

      adolescents.



      This study will enroll children who participated in PACTG 219C or various IMPAACT studies.

      There will be no study visits specifically for this study. Researchers will review

      participants' medical records annually and collect information on illnesses, medications,

      CD4 cell count and viral load data, and body measurements.

    <brief_summary>

      Minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and Membranous

      nephropathy (MN), generate an enormous individual and societal financial burden, accounting

      for approximately 12% of prevalent end stage renal disease (ESRD) cases (2005) at an annual

      cost in the US of more than $3 billion. However, the clinical classification of these

      diseases is widely believed to be inadequate by the scientific community. Given the poor

      understanding of MCD/FSGS and MN biology, it is not surprising that the available therapies

      are imperfect. The therapies lack a clear biological basis, and as many families have

      experienced, they are often not beneficial, and in fact may be significantly toxic. Given

      these observations, it is essential that research be conducted that address these serious

      obstacles to effectively caring for patients.



      In response to a request for applications by the National Institutes of Health, Office of

      Rare Diseases (NIH, ORD) for the creation of Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortia, a

      number of affiliated universities joined together with The NephCure Foundation the NIDDK,

      the ORDR, and the University of Michigan in collaboration towards the establishment of a

      Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium.



      Through this consortium the investigators hope to understand the fundamental biology of

      these rare diseases and aim to bank long-term observational data and corresponding

      biological specimens for researchers to access and further enrich.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare disease syndrome responsible for approximately

      12% of all causes of end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) and up to 20% of ESRD in children.

      Treatment strategies for Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Minimal Change

      Disease (MCD) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN), the major causes of NS, include high dose

      prolonged steroid therapy, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, mycophenolate

      mofetil and other immunosuppressive agents, which all carry significant side effects.

      Failure to obtain remission using the current treatment approaches frequently results in

      progression to ESRD with its associated costs, morbidities, and mortality. In the North

      American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) registry, half of the

      pediatric patients with Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome required renal replacement

      therapy within two years of being enrolled in the disease registry. FSGS also has a high

      recurrence rate following kidney transplantation (30-40%) and is the most common recurrent

      disease leading to allograft loss.



      The prevailing classification of Nephrotic Syndrome categorizes patients into FSGS, MCD, and

      MN, if in the absence of other underlying causes, glomerular histology shows a specific

      histological pattern. This classification does not adequately predict the heterogeneous

      natural history of patients with FSGS, MCD, and MN. Major advances in understanding the

      pathogenesis of FSGS and MCD have come over the last ten years from the identification of

      several mutated genes responsible for causing Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome (SRNS)

      presenting with FSGS or MCD histopathology in humans and model organisms. These functionally

      distinct genetic disorders can present with indistinguishable FSGS lesions on histology

      confirming the presence of heterogeneous pathogenic mechanisms under the current

      histological diagnoses.



      The limited understanding of FSGS, MCD, and MN biology in humans has necessitated a

      descriptive classification system in which heterogeneous disorders are grouped together.

      This invariably consigns these heterogeneous patients to the same therapeutic approaches,

      which use blunt immunosuppressive drugs that lack a clear biological basis, are often not

      beneficial, and are complicated by significant toxicity. The foregoing shortcomings make a

      strong case that concerted and innovative investigational strategies combining basic

      science, translational, and clinical methods should be employed to study FSGS, MCD, and MN.

      It is for these reasons that the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network is established to conduct

      clinical and translational research in patients with FSGS/MCD and MN.

    <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label (i.e all people involved know the identity of the intervention),

      single-arm, roll-over trial of telaprevir in combination with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)

      alfa-2a and ribavirin (RBV). The purpose of the trial is to provide access to telaprevir for

      patients who were randomized to the control group in the VX-950-TiDP24-C216 trial (referred

      to as C216 trial hereafter) and who failed therapy for virologic reasons. The efficacy,

      safety, and tolerability of telaprevir in combination with Peg IFN alfa 2a and RBV will be

      evaluated. In addition, amino acid changes from baseline in the HCV NS3 (i.e protein

      associated with the hepatitis C virus) protease domain will be evaluated. The trial will

      consist of a screening period of approximately 28 days, a 48-week treatment period, and a

      24-week follow-up period. It is expected that approximately 120 patients could be eligible

      for enrollment. Since the C216 trial is blinded until all patients reach Week 72 (or have

      discontinued earlier), patients can only enter the current trial upon invitation. The

      investigator will receive an invitation sent by the unblinded independent virology monitor

      of the C216 trial for those patients of the C216 trial who were randomized to the control

      group and who failed therapy for virologic reasons. Next to this invitation, the patient

      will need to fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the current trial in order to

      be eligible to participate. The screening visit for the current trial can only occur after

      the patient completes all assessments in the C216 trial, including the Safety Follow-up

      Visit. Patients must not enter this trial later than 80 weeks after their first dose in the

      C216 trial. In the current trial, all patients will receive 12 weeks of telaprevir 750 mg

      every 8 hours (q8h) in combination with Peg-IFN alfa-2a and RBV at standard doses, i.e., 180

      microgram once weekly and 1,000 or 1,200 mg/day (weight based), respectively, followed by 36

      weeks of Peg IFN alfa 2a and RBV at standard doses. Patients with hepatitis C virus RNA

      levels &lt; 25 IU/mL undetectable at the end of treatment (Week 48 or having discontinued

      earlier) will be followed for 24 weeks after the last dose of study medication to assess

      sustained virologic response (SVR). Safety/tolerability assessments will be performed and

      adverse events (AEs), regardless of severity, will be collected continuously until the

      Safety Follow-up Visit, scheduled 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication.

      Thereafter, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported. All patients will receive

      12 weeks of telaprevir 750 mg q8h (orally) in combination with Peg-IFN alfa-2a and RBV at

      standard doses, i.e., 180 microgram once weekly (injection) and 1,000 or 1,200 mg/day

      (weight-based) (orally), respectively, followed by 36 weeks of Peg IFN alfa-2a and RBV at

      standard doses.

    <brief_summary>

      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta

      cells are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to

      assess the benefit of islet transplantation in type 1 diabetic (T1D) kidney transplant

      recipients.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Type 1 diabetes is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple

      insulin injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin

      therapy allows long-term survival in individuals with type 1 diabetes; however, it does not

      guarantee constant normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic

      survivors often develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease

      that can cause poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that

      can lead to kidney failure and thus kidney transplant. Some individuals with type 1 diabetes

      develop hypoglycemia unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable

      with medication and is characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia.

      For such individuals, pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation are possible treatment

      options. The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of islet transplantation in type

      1 diabetic kidney transplant recipients.



      Participants in this study will be type I diabetics who have received a kidney transplant

      for ESRD.. If subjects have not received ITT in the 12 months prior to enrollment, they must

      undergo a period of standardized diabetes care by an experienced diabetologist at the

      transplant center using the current ADA's standards of medical care in diabetes. Throughout

      the study, all participants will remain on the immunosuppressive therapy intended for their

      kidney. Participants will receive up to three separate islet transplants and a regimen of

      immunosuppressive medications consisting of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and etanercept.

      They will begin receiving ATG 2 days prior to transplant and will continue to receive ATG

      until Day 2 post-transplant. Etanercept will be given on the day of transplant and on Days

      3, 7, and 10 post-transplant.



      Transplantations will involve an inpatient hospital stay and infusion of islets into a

      branch of the portal vein. Participants who do not achieve or maintain insulin independence

      by Day 30 post-transplant will be considered for a second islet transplant. Participants who

      remain dependent on insulin for longer than 30 days after the second transplant and who show

      partial graft function will be considered for a third islet transplant. Daclizumab will be

      used in place of ATG for the second and third transplants, if they are necessary.

      Participants who do not meet the criteria for a subsequent transplant will enter a reduced

      follow-up period.



      There will be approximately 15 study visits. A physical exam, review of adverse events, and

      blood collection will occur at most visits. A chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound,

      electrocardiogram, quality of life questionnaires, and urine collection will occur at some

      visits. Participants will also test their own blood glucose levels throughout the study. A

      36-month follow-up period will take place after the participant's last transplant,

      consisting of 8 additional visits.

      Protocol to screen potential subjects for islet transplantation

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Subjects with Type 1 diabetes and history of severe hypoglycemia will undergo screening

      similar to the screening done for islet transplantation including: history; physical; chest

      X rays; upper GI series if history of ulcer; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound with careful

      attention to liver parenchyma and gallbladder; EKG; stress echocardiography if older than

      35, psychological evaluation; autonomic and sensorimotor evaluation. They will also have a

      tuberculosis skin test (PPD), and pre-transplant laboratory tests, including: serology (for

      hepatitis B and C, HTLV I and II, Herpesvirus 1 and 2, CMV, EBV, Parvovirus B19, RPR and

      HIV); first morning urine (albumin, protein and creatinine), GFR; urinalysis and urine

      culture; CBC, chemistry, PT, PTT, INR, C-peptide (basal and stimulated), HbA1c, , lipid

      profile, LFTs, thyroid profile, blood typing, PRA, MHC determination, auto-antibodies

      (GAD65, IA2 and insulin), and if male, prostate specific antigen (PSA). Severity of glucose

      lability and hypoglycemia unawareness is assessed with Clarke score, Lability index, Mage

      and hypoglycemia score.

    <brief_summary>

      Many individuals with schizophrenia also suffer from marijuana addiction that worsens their

      problems related to schizophrenia. Most of the medications prescribed for schizophrenia have

      no effect on reducing marijuana use. Preliminary data suggests that clozapine, an atypical

      antipsychotic, may limit marijuana use in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, but it is not

      commonly used due to its side effects and is reserved for people who do not respond to other

      antipsychotic medications.



      In the proposed study, 132 individuals who are diagnosed with both schizophrenia and a

      cannabis use disorder will be randomized to a 12-week treatment course with either clozapine

      or risperidone (another commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication) to test the hypothesis

      that patient treated with clozapine will have decreased cannabis use as compared to patients

      treated with risperidone.



      Should this study indicate that clozapine will lessen marijuana use in persons diagnosed

      with schizophrenia more than risperidone, it will provide evidence needed to begin to shift

      clinical practice toward its use in this population.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Cannabis use disorder (CUD), which is up to ten times more common in patients with

      schizophrenia (SCZ) than in the general population, worsens the course of this severe

      psychiatric disorder. Since SCZ occurs in 1% of the population, the co-occurrence of CUD in

      13% to 42% of people with this disorder presents society with an important public health

      problem. Unfortunately, most antipsychotics available for treatment of patients with SCZ do

      not appear to limit their cannabis use. Moreover, the one antipsychotic that preliminary

      data suggest may well limit cannabis use in these patients, clozapine (CLOZ), is not used

      for this purpose; it is reserved for patients whose psychosis is treatment resistant.



      The overarching idea behind this proposal, however, is that CLOZ's use is being unreasonably

      restricted and should be made more widely available for patients with SCZ who have a

      co-occurring CUD but whose psychosis is not necessarily treatment resistant. This notion is

      supported by our preliminary clinical and animal data on the effects of CLOZ, as well as our

      neurobiological model of the basis of cannabis use in patients with SCZ that provides a

      pharmacologic rationale for this effect of CLOZ.



      Even given all the arguments favoring the potential benefits of CLOZ in patients with SCZ

      and CUD, however, its side effect profile will likely limit its use until a fully powered

      study demonstrates its ability to decrease cannabis use in patients with SCZ. This proposal

      aims to launch such a study. If, as we hypothesize, this study confirms and extends our

      previous preliminary data of the effects of CLOZ in patients with SCZ and CUD, it will

      provide a strong impetus to expand the use of CLOZ in this population.



      In the proposed study, 132 patients who are comorbid for both SCZ and CUD will be randomized

      to a 12-week treatment course with either CLOZ or risperidone (RISP) to test the hypothesis

      that patients treated with CLOZ will have decreased cannabis use as compared to patients

      treated with RISP. In addition, the study will determine whether patients treated with CLOZ

      will have improvements in psychiatric symptoms, quality of life neuropsychological functions

      as compared to those taking RISP. We will also explore whether patients taking CLOZ show

      improved reward responsiveness as compared to those taking RISP. Finally, this study will

      explore whether those patients with the val/val genotype at the COMT Val158Met locus are

      more likely to decrease cannabis use during CLOZ treatment than are those without the

      val/val COMT genotype.



      Should this study indicate that CLOZ will lessen cannabis use in patients with SCZ more than

      RISP, it will provide evidence needed to begin to shift clinical practice toward its use in

      these patients.

      Laser therapy for basal cell carcinoma may be a superior option for patients who do not wish

      to or cannot tolerate other treatment modalities such as topical chemotherapeutics or

      surgery.



      In this pilot study, we will preliminarily assess the efficacy and safety of the 595/1064 nm

      Multiplex laser when treating superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas less than 1.5 cm

      in size. This is an unblinded study in which patients will be randomized to either a

      treatment arm or a control arm. Patients in the treatment arm will receive three treatments

      with the 595/1064 nm multiplex laser spaced four weeks apart. The control group will visit

      the clinic with the same schedule as the treatment group for monitoring of the lesion. All

      patients will return one month after last treatment session or clinical visit, for

      evaluation of clinical and histological clearance.

    <detailed_description>

      Basal cell carcinoma is a malignancy with significant prevalence that rarely metastasizes

      but can be locally destructive. Laser therapy for this type of lesion may be a superior

      option for patients who do not wish to or cannot tolerate other modalities such as topical

      chemotherapeutics or surgery.



      In this pilot study, we will preliminarily assess the efficacy and safety of the 595/1064 nm

      Multiplex laser when treating superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas less than 1.5 cm

      in size. Eligible patients with biopsy-proven superficial or nodular BCCs less than 1.5 cm

      in size will have the opportunity to enroll in this study. This is an unblinded study in

      which patients will be randomized to either a treatment arm or a control arm. Patients in

      the treatment arm will receive three treatments with the 595/1064 nm multiplex laser spaced

      four weeks apart. In addition to assessing the presence of any adverse effects, photographs

      will be taken at each visit. One month after the last treatment session, patients in this

      group will return for evaluation of 1) clinical clearance and 2) histological clearance of

      their BCC. In order to assess clinical clearance, a dermatologist will grossly examine,

      measure, and document any residual lesion. Afterwards, a deep excisional biopsy encompassing

      the entire region will be taken and histological clearance will be determined by a

      microscopic examination for any residual tumor cells. Follow-up for wound care of the biopsy

      will occur one week later. Tumor burden will be calculated by change in surface area of the

      lesion.



      After standard diagnostic biopsy, patients in the control arm will be followed for three

      regular visits, spaced 4 weeks apart. One month after the third follow-up visit, control

      patients will return for final photography and evaluation of clinical and histological

      clearance, just as the treatment arm. Although extremely rare1, if any clinical signs of

      progression are visible during this period (what we will consider greater than 10% growth),

      the patient will be withdrawn from the study and will undergo standard of care treatment.

      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving temozolomide and irinotecan

      hydrochloride together with or without bevacizumab works in treating young patients with

      recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma or central nervous system (CNS) primitive

      neuroectodermal tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and irinotecan

      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing

      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal

      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the

      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or

      carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and

      irinotecan hydrochloride are more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating

      medulloblastoma or CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      l. To compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects receiving the combination of

      temozolomide and irinotecan with that of subjects receiving temozolomide, irinotecan

      (irinotecan hydrochloride), and bevacizumab for recurrent medulloblastoma (MB)/primitive

      neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of childhood.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To assess the response rate for each treatment arm amongst patients who are enrolled with

      measurable disease.



      II. To determine event-free survival (EFS) for each patient compared across regimens.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90

      minutes on days 1-5.



      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO and irinotecan hydrochloride IV as in arm I and

      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.



      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the 3-year graft failure rate following

      endothelial keratoplasty performed with donor corneas with a preservation time of 8 to 14

      days is non-inferior to the failure rate when donor corneas with a preservation time of 7 or

      fewer days are used.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      When the donor cornea is removed from the person who died, it is prepared for

      transplantation by an eye bank. The donor cornea is placed into a liquid that helps preserve

      the cornea until it is transplanted. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved

      storage of the cornea in this liquid for up to 14 days before the transplant. The purpose of

      this study is to see if the length of time the donor cornea is kept in the preservation

      liquid before the transplant affects the likelihood of the transplant being successful. We

      will follow participants for 3 years after transplant to see if there are any differences in

      transplant success or in the number of transplanted endothelial cells (the layer of cells

      that line the undersurface of the cornea) on the corneas that were preserved for 7 days or

      less compared to those preserved between 8 and 14 days. We have no reason to believe that

      there is any greater risk for transplant failure with either preservation time group.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of autologous human Schwann cells (ahSC)

      transplantation in subjects with subacute SCI.



      For humans with subacute SCI, we hypothesize that axons might show improved function if

      myelin repair is induced with the implantation of ahSC. In addition spinal cord cavitation

      may be reduced, and neural sprouting and plasticity may be enhanced via neurotrophic

      effects.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Schwann cells are excellent candidates for transplantation into humans with SCI. Large

      numbers of ahSC can be derived for autologous implantation after a minor surgery for

      peripheral nerve harvesting, and purification and expansion of the cells in culture.

      Autologous cells offer important safety advantages that include no need for immune

      suppression, minimal risk of disease transfer, and a low risk of tumorigenicity.



      Since 1990, scientists at the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis have generated extensive

      preclinical data suggesting Schwann cell transplantations are successful in rodents with

      SCI. The most recent work has focused on contusive injury models that are relevant to human

      injury. They have also been largely responsible for developing an efficient method for

      procuring large, essentially pure populations of human Schwann cells from adult peripheral

      nerve.



      The rationale for implantation of ahSC in people with acute SCI is based on the evidence

      that Schwann cells are neuroprotective and are capable of myelinating axons. Using mitogen

      expanded human Schwann cells in SCID mice and athymic female nude rats demonstrated that

      human Schwann cells can survive and are capable of enhancing axonal regeneration and forming

      myelin after transplantation in animals with sciatic nerve transection or thoracic spinal

      cord transection. The proposed clinical trial will advance knowledge about the safety and

      feasibility of a cell-based treatment strategy for human SCI.



      This Phase 1 clinical trial will employ an open label, unblinded, nonrandomized and

      non-placebo controlled dose-escalation design to evaluate the safety of transplantation of

      ahSC transplantation in subjects with subacute SCI.



      A sural nerve harvest will occur within 30 days post-injury. Standard-of-care medical

      treatment and rehabilitation will proceed while the cells are being processed in a cGMP

      facility. No later than 72 days post-injury, the ahSC product will be administered via a

      single injection into the cavity of the spinal cord lesion.



      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at week 1 and 2 post-transplantation and

      2, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of Valproic Acid (VPA) to both

      slow the progression of visual function loss and/or to restore visual function in patients

      with Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and to collect safety and tolerability

      information.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an incurable and untreatable group of heterogeneous retinal

      degenerative diseases that cause severe visual loss. There is currently no therapeutic that

      substantially slows the progression of this disease, and certainly none that can restore

      vision in RP patients. The Valproic Acid (VPA) study is designed as a six-site,

      interventional, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded study of 90

      participants to evaluate the efficacy of oral Valproic Acid to both slow the progression of

      visual function loss and/or to restore visual function in patients with an Autosomal

      Dominant RP genetic mutation and to collect safety and tolerability information. Patients

      that participate in the study will be randomized to either placebo or VPA in a 1:1 ratio.

    <brief_summary>

      The (Catheter Ablation Versus Anti-arrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation Trial)

      CABANA Trial has the overall goal of establishing the appropriate roles for medical and

      ablative intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF). The CABANA Trial is designed to test the

      hypothesis that the treatment strategy of left atrial catheter ablation for the purpose of

      eliminating atrial fibrillation (AF) will be superior to current state-of-the-art therapy

      with either rate control or rhythm control drugs for decreasing the incidence of the

      composite endpoint of total mortality, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest

      in patients with untreated or incompletely treated AF.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The need for this trial arises out of 1) the rapidly increasing number of pts &gt; 60 years of

      age with AF accompanied by symptoms and morbidity, 2) the failure of anti-arrhythmic drug

      therapy to maintain sinus rhythm and reduce mortality, 3) the rapidly increasing application

      of radio-frequency catheter ablation without appropriate evidence-based validation, and 4)

      the expanding impact of AF on health care costs.



      This study will randomize up to 2200 patients to a strategy of catheter ablation versus

      pharmacologic therapy with rate or rhythm control drugs. Each pt will have 1)

      characteristics similar to AFFIRM pts (≥65 yo or &lt;65 with &gt;1 risk factor for stroke, 2)

      Documented AF warranting treatment, and 3) Eligibility for both catheter ablation and ≥2

      anti-arrhythmic or ≥2 rate control drugs. Pts will be followed every 6 months for an average

      of approximately 5 years and will undergo repeat trans-telephonic monitor, Holter monitor,

      and CT/MR studies to assess the impact of treatment.



      The CABANA trial will disclose the role of medical and non-pharmacologic therapies for AF,

      establish the cost and impact of therapy on quality of life and will help determine if AF is

      a modifiable risk factor for increased mortality.

    <brief_summary>

      The goal of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the light-emitting diode (LED) in

      promoting healing of the wound on lower leg as a result of surgery. Wounds on the lower leg

      heal more slowly than wounds on the head and neck; they can also remain deep red for six

      months to one year. Doctors usually allow a lower leg surgical wound to heal by itself,

      without stitches or other additional treatment. This is because leg wounds do not hold

      stitches well and stitches could cause other problems. A major drawback of allowing a

      surgical wound on the lower leg to heal by itself is the long healing time that can often

      take months. The investigators wish to evaluate if the LED light treatment of the surgical

      wound will improve the healing of your wound.



      In order to test if leg wounds heal faster after treatment with LED, half of the patients in

      the study will receive the LED (Group 2) and half will not receive treatment with LED but

      will receive a "sham light" treatment (Group 1). Essentially, a sham light treatment refers

      to regular light (not LED) exposure for 20 minutes. The sham light comes from the same

      device as the treatment light (Omnilux machine) however, this light has no anticipated

      effects on wound healing and is used simply to reduce the amount of bias that sometimes

      complicates the results of these studies. There is no added risk or benefit for the patients

      in the control group exposed to the sham light. Both groups will receive the standard care

      of wounds on the lower extremity.

      Groups 1 and 2 will receive 4 sham light or treatment sessions, respectively (one session

      every week for 4 weeks). After these sessions are done, all subjects will continue weekly

      follow up visits until the wound is closed, or 3 months after the surgery have passed; which

      ever happens first.



      One final follow up visit will occur 1 week after the wound closed.

    <brief_summary>

      The study is a 2-arm, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial.



      All subjects will receive close monitoring for development of AGT or T1DM. Subjects will

      receive Abatacept or placebo and close monitoring for development of AGT or T1DM. To assess

      the safety, efficacy, and mode of action of Abatacept to prevent AGT and T1DM.



      The primary objective is to determine whether intervention with Abatacept will prevent or

      delay the development of AGT in at-risk autoantibody positive non-diabetic relatives of

      patients with T1DM.



      Secondary outcomes include: the effect of Abatacept on the incidence of T1DM; analyses of

      C-peptide and other measures from the OGTT; safety and tolerability; and mechanistic

      outcomes.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Study Purpose and Rationale:



      In this study, relatives who are confirmed to have two or more antibodies, not including

      mIAA, and normal glucose tolerance will be eligible for randomization to experimental

      treatment or placebo groups with the aim to determine whether experimental treatment will

      prevent or delay the occurrence of abnormal glucose tolerance and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      Individuals with normal glucose tolerance are earlier in the disease process; that is, have

      less beta cell destruction than those with abnormal glucose tolerance or frank diabetes, yet

      will inevitably progress to clinical disease and essentially complete beta cell loss.

      Treatment at this early stage in a population who will inevitably progress to type 1

      diabetes provides the greatest opportunity for a clinically important impact on disease

      prevention. With abnormal glucose tolerance rather than diabetes as the primary endpoint,

      study participants, regulators, funders, and investigators will be able to determine whether

      the therapy can alter disease progression.



      Therefore, the rationale for this study is that individuals with immunologic markers of T1DM

      and normal glucose tolerance will inevitably develop clinical T1DM. Prior to development of

      clinical T1DM they will progress from normal glucose tolerance to abnormal glucose

      tolerance; and abnormal glucose tolerance results in clinical T1DM within 5 years in almost

      80% of subjects. They have a condition that differs from overt diabetes only in the duration

      of the autoimmune process that results in beta cell destruction. Intervention early in the

      course of disease may be more effective than intervention in those with abnormal glucose

      tolerance or clinical T1DM.



      Description of Treatment Groups



      Subjects will be randomized to receive either Abatacept or placebo infusions along with

      close monitoring for abnormal glucose tolerance or diabetes. The infusions will be conducted

      at approved TrialNet clinical sites with appropriate facilities. All blood and serum samples

      for the primary and secondary outcome determinations will be sent to the Core Laboratories

      for analysis. Clinical laboratory studies may be done at the local sites.



      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (within the two strata defined by age

      at enrollment: &lt;18 and 18 or older) to the following 2 groups:



        -  to receive Abatacept (intravenous infusion at 0, 2, and 4 weeks following

           randomization, and then every 28+/-7 days) thereafter for a total of 14 doses. Close

           monitoring for diabetes development through the duration of study.



        -  to receive placebo intravenous infusion at 0, 2, and 4 weeks following randomization

           and then every 28+/- 7 days thereafter for a total of 14 doses. Close monitoring for

           diabetes development through the duration of study.



      Treatment Assignment



      After participants sign the consent form, complete the screening visit(s), and meet all of

      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, participants will be randomized

      to receive either Abatacept and close monitoring or placebo with close monitoring.



      Participants will be randomized in equal allocations to each group. The randomization method

      will be stratified by TrialNet study site and whether the participant is less than 18 years

      of age or 18 years and older. This approach ensures that study site will not be a potential

      confounder. The TNCC will generate the randomization numbers and tables.



      Study Assessments



      During the course of the study, participants will frequently undergo assessments of their

      glucose tolerance status, insulin production, immunologic status, and overall health and

      well-being.



      Samples will be drawn for storage in the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and

      Kidney Disease (NIDDK) Repository and at TrialNet Laboratory Sites for future analysis

      related to T1DM.



      Study Duration



      The study has been designed to provide 80% power to detect a 40% risk reduction in the

      occurrence of abnormal glucose tolerance using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level after six

      years of study duration. A total of approximately 206 patients will be allocated in a 1:1

      ratio to the two groups.

    <brief_summary>

      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA)

      to prevent or delay major amputation and/or death in subjects with critical limb ischemia

      (CLI) due to severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial

      intended for subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) that are unsuitable for

      revascularization. The investigational treatment utilizes autologous concentrated bone

      marrow aspirate (cBMA) at the point of care. The bone marrow aspirate is obtained from the

      subject's hip, concentrated with a bone marrow concentration device, and delivered

      intramuscularly to the affected limb. Subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will

      be randomized to receive either the investigational treatment (cBMA) or a placebo control

      (sham treatment).

    <brief_summary>

      Since its inception, the Diabetes Research Institute (DRI) has made significant

      contributions to the field of diabetes, pioneering many of the techniques used in diabetes

      centers around the world. Through several clinical trials, DRI has demonstrated that

      diabetes can be successfully reversed as a result of islet cell transplant.



      Over the years the following protocols in islet cell transplantation have been initiated:

      2000/0329; 2000/0196; 2004/0205; 2000/024; 2006/0200; 2006/0508; 2006/0210.



      All of the studies listed above will be source of study subjects for this study.

      Approximately 30 subjects are expected to be enrolled and followed in this trial.



      After islet-cell transplantation in the parent studies, each subject receives maintenance

      immunosuppressive medications.



      The purpose of this protocol is to collect additional follow-up for safety and efficacy from

      subjects with graft function after their completion in their parent study. It is expected

      that most subjects will retain measurable islet function and, in the islet-alone studies,

      continue to receive immunosuppressive medications at the time of completing their parent

      study.

             unwillingness to use effective contraceptive measures for the duration of the study

             and 4 months after discontinuation. For male subjects: intent to procreate during the

             duration of the study or within 4 months after discontinuation or unwillingness to

             use effective measures of contraception. Oral contraceptives, Norplant®,

             Depo-Provera®, and barrier devices with spermicide are acceptable contraceptive

             methods; condoms used alone are not acceptable.



          2. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies how well giving cisplatin and radiation therapy

      together with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel works in treating patients with locally

      advanced cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and

      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the

      cells or by stopping them from dividing. External radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays

      to kill tumor cells. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or

      near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and external

      and internal radiation therapy together with carboplatin and paclitaxel kills more tumor

      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine if the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to standard cisplatin-based

      chemoradiation improves overall survival.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine the progression-free survival rates. II. To determine acute and long-term

      toxicities. III. To determine patterns of disease recurrence. IV. To determine the

      association between radiation protocol compliance and outcomes.



      V. To determine patient quality of life, including psycho-sexual health.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine the association between the results of a follow-up positron emission

      tomography (PET) scan performed 4-6 months post completion of chemoradiation and outcomes

      for all patients in the trial.



      II. To determine the biological predictors of patients' outcomes based on translational

      laboratory studies of blood and tissue specimens.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to pelvic or common

      iliac nodal involvement (yes vs no), requirement for extended-field radiotherapy treatment

      (yes vs no), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (IB/IIA vs

      IIB vs IIIB/IVA), age (&lt; 60 years of age vs &gt;= 60 years of age), and hospital/site. Patients

      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,

      22, and 29. Patients also undergo external-beam radiation therapy once daily, 5 days a week,

      for approximately 5 weeks. Patients then undergo high-dose rate, pulsed-dose rate, or

      low-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy.



      ARM II: Patients receive cisplatin and undergo external-beam radiation and brachytherapy as

      in arm I. Beginning 4 weeks later, patients also receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprising

      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every

      21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      Patients may undergo baseline tumor biopsy and blood collection for future correlative

      studies.



      Patients complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)

      Core questionnaire (QLQ-C30), the EORTC cervix cancer module (CX24), the ovarian cancer

      module (OV28), and the Sexual function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire (SVQ) questionnaires at

      baseline, during, and after completion of study treatment.



      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and

      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <brief_summary>

      Hemophilia A is an inherited blood disorder in which one protein, Factor VIII, needed to

      form blood clots is missing or not present in sufficient levels. Hemophilia A causes the

      clotting process to be slowed and the person experiences bleeds causing serious problems

      that could lead to disability. The current standard treatment for severe hemophilia A is

      infusion of FVIII to stop bleeding, or regular scheduled treatment to prevent bleeds from

      occuring. Due to the short half-life of FVIII, prophylaxis may require treatment as often as

      every other day.



      In this trial safety and efficacy of a long-acting recombinant Factor VIII molecule is being

      evaluated in 50 male subjects, &lt; 12 years of age, with severe Hemophilia A. These subjects

      will receive open label treatment with long-acting rFVIII for approximately 6 months (or

      longer until 50 exposure days) on a regular schedule at least once every 7-days. Doses and

      dose intervals may be adapted to the subject's clinical need. A second group of patients

      will receive open label treatment with the same drug for 12 weeks on a regular schedule of

      2x/week. Patients will attend the treatment center for routine blood samples and will be

      required to keep an electronic diary.



      Subjects will be offered participation in an optional extension study to collect

      observations for at least an additional 50 exposure days.

    <brief_summary>

      Most premature infants require mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods of time and a

      significant proportion of them develop Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). Caffeine is a

      stimulant of the respiratory center and has been used for the treatment of Apnea of

      Prematurity in infants not requiring mechanical ventilation or to facilitate weaning from

      mechanical ventilation by starting therapy shortly before extubation. Recently the use of

      Caffeine in ventilated infants has been initiated earlier because of the reported reduction

      in BPD. However there is paucity of data supporting this practice.



      Because protracted mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen increase the risk of

      developing BPD, a therapy that would facilitate the reduction of the respiratory support and

      shorten its duration is desirable. Therefore, it is of importance to evaluate the effects of

      early Caffeine initiation and administration during the course of mechanical ventilation in

      preterm infants by means of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.



      Hypothesis:



      The primary hypothesis of this study is that early use of caffeine in mechanically

      ventilated preterm infants will reduce the time to first elective extubation and

      secondarily, that this will reduce the total duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen

      supplementation, and reduce the incidence and severity of BPD.



      Objective:



      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of early caffeine use during

      mechanical ventilation on the time to first elective extubation, total duration of

      mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation, and the incidence of BPD.



      Study Design:



      This will be a single-center prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled

      clinical trial.



      Population:



      Premature neonates born between 23 and 30 completed weeks of gestation, who require

      mechanical ventilation within the first 5 days of life will be enrolled. Infants with major

      congenital anomalies or small for gestational age will be excluded.



      Methods:



      Infants will be randomized within the first 5 days to receive a study drug consisting of

      either blinded Caffeine citrate or blinded Placebo (equivalent volume of normal saline).

      Infants will continue to receive the study drug until the first elective extubation.

    <brief_summary>

      This study will determine the safety of allogeneic stem cell therapy from healthy donors,

      for 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA), at four

      different dose levels.



      Clinical evaluation will take place every 1 to 4 weeks intervals until wound closure, and

      then monthly for 6 months following the last administration of MSCs.



      Once the safety and dose-response analysis in Phase 1 is completed, an expanded trial will

      be initiated to better examine the efficacy of MSC therapy in 2nd degree burn wounds. Phase

      1 will establish the maximum safe dose that will be used in the Phase II trial.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The study will include a Phase 1 trial. A tissue repository will be collected. The

      recipients in the Phases 1 of the study will be inpatients at Jackson. Their enrollment will

      continue into the outpatient setting. The donors will be recruited through the University of

      Miami (UM). The donors will present for 2 clinic visits, and after the bone marrow

      aspiration, the study team will contact the donor by phone 2 times (Initial call 24-48 hrs.

      and then 30-60 days after Donation).



      RECIPIENTS



      Recipients will be screened upon presentation to the hospital. To establish enrollment, the

      wound will be examined and measured. A complete medical history and physical exam will be

      performed. Blood will be collected to test for blood bourne pathogens, including hepatitis

      and HIV. A pregnancy test will be done for females. Once the patient is enrolled, MSC's will

      be applied according to the dose and frequency determined by the Phase 1 trial. At various

      intervals, skin biopsies, wound measurements, questionnaires and possibly bone marrow

      aspirate may be performed (see below).



      Study Design for Specific Phase 1:



      This will represent the Phase 1 portion of the study. It will asses the safety of delivering

      MSC's to burn wounds. A total of 20 patients will be recruited and divided into 4 groups.

      These groups will be taken through a dose escalation method, i.e. the first group will be

      started on the lowest dose. If there are no adverse reactions, the second group will receive

      a higher dose. This will be repeated for the third and fourth groups with each receiving a

      higher dose. If necessary, a second dose of MSC's will be given. Each administration will be

      given no less than 10 days apart but no more than 6 weeks apart. Second doses will not be

      given until it is evident that no significant adverse events occured from the first

      administration. There will be a maximum of 2 administrations of MSC's. At the end of each

      dose level, safety data will be presented to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and

      the Institutional Review Board (IRB). If there were no significant adverse events or

      concerns from either party, the protocol will continue to the next dose level.



      Rejection will be monitored with blood tests before, between and after receiving MSC's, as

      well as clinical evaluation. Upon discharge from the hospital, patients will be asked to

      come to clinic at 1- 4 week intervals depending on the course of the individual patient.

      Home nursing care may be arranged if necessary for dressing changes. During clinic visits,

      the wounds will be assessed and questionnaires done. During this time, the patients will

      also have necessary evaluations and sessions with physical and occupational therapy. Once

      the wound is considered healed, patients may be asked to return to clinic monthly to ensure

      that the wound remains healed.



      At the completion of the Phase 1 trial, all safety data will be sent to the DSMB, monitor,

      IRB and FDA. If no significant safety issues arise, the study is anticipated to progress to

      Phase 2 .



      Blood sample and tissue repository:



      During the course of the study, many samples will be taken. These include serum, blood

      cells, tissue and skin cells. These samples may be taken from donors and recipients. These

      samples may be able to provide insight into biomarkers which may be used to predict healing

      and scarring. As such, they may be stored for further, non-clinical research in the tissue

      repository. Patients would have signed away their rights to these samples.



      SCHEDULE FOR RECIPIENTS (all Phase 1 patients).



      Week 1:



      Health and medications will be recorded. Samples of blood will be drawn for safety and

      research purposes. A skin biopsy from the wound may be performed and the wound will be

      evaluated/measured. Prior to treatment, 2nd degree burn subjects will be reassessed to

      determine if wound healing is likely within the next week. If &gt; 30% of the wound is closed

      and significant evidence of healing is present, this subject will be excluded from further

      participation in the study.



      MSC's will be applied to the wound. A film dressing to hold the cells in place may be

      applied. This dressing would be removed 12-48 hours post-operatively. The wound will be

      dressed with the appropriate dressing for the specific type of wound. Wounds will also be

      photographed.



      Week 3 to 26:



      Patients will return to clinic. Additional samples of blood may be obtained for research

      purposes. Questionnaires will be completed with inquiries into changes in health and

      medications. Wounds will be evaluated and measured, as well as photographed. Dead tissue

      will be cleaned if necessary. Appropriate dressing changes will be done. If needed, MSC's

      will be applied to wounds for the second time. The application will be no less than 10 days

      apart but no more than 6 weeks apart. Again if cells are applied, a film dressing to hold

      the cells in may be applied. This dressing can be removed in 12-48 hours.



      Signs of rejection will be monitored. Blood tests will be done per investigators discretion.

      Skin biopsies may also be performed. If rejection or reaction is suspected, patients will no

      longer be eligible to receive any more donor cells.



      After Week 26 or End of Treatment Visit:



      If the wound is healed, a biopsy of the wound may be done. Samples of blood may be drawn for

      research purposes. These patients will return to clinic monthly to ensure that the wound

      stays closed. If the wound remains unhealed, it will be measured and photographed. Note that

      patients with healed wounds may refuse biopsy. Appropriate dressing changes will be done.

      Questions about health and medications will be asked.



      DONORS



      Approximately 10 donor will be used to harvest MSC's. Initially, potential donors will

      present for a screening visit. Here, a physical exam will be done, in addition to a

      screening questionnaire. Medical history will be collected. Blood samples will also be taken

      to be tested for blood bourne pathogens, including hepatitis and HIV. A urine sample will be

      collected as well. If a potential donor meets the screening criteria, they will return for a

      second, 'donation' visit. At this visit, vital signs will be recorded and a bone marrow

      aspirate will be done. The bone marrow aspirates will be done by Dr. John Byrnes, a

      hematologist/oncologist who routinely performs these aspirates for the stem cell trials here

      at UM. This second visit will take place within 1 week of the initial visit. A biomarker

      test may be involved. The evaluation of specific biomarkers may help to determine the effect

      of stem cell delivery to burn wounds. In order to provide this type of examination, removal

      and analysis of nucleic acids derived from donor materials may be needed. A separate genetic

      research consent will be provided to the donor.



      GENETIC TESTING



      The biomarker/genetic tests may be performed on materials obtained from both donors and

      recipients. The samples could include bone marrow aspirate, blood and tissue. The tests will

      be performed primarily to detect the expressions of levels of genes important for healing,

      tissue repair and inflammation.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to provide patients who have received at least one islet

      transplant as a previous participant in a Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium (CIT)

      clinical trial with maintenance immunosuppressive medications and to collect information

      about the safety of the medications and islet function.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      After islet-cell transplantation in the CIT studies*, each subject receives maintenance

      immunosuppressive medications.



      The purpose of this protocol is to collect additional follow-up for safety and efficacy from

      CIT subjects with graft function after their completion in their CIT parent study. It is

      expected that most subjects will retain measurable islet function and, in the islet-alone

      studies, continue to receive immunosuppressive medications at the time of completing their

      CIT parent study.



      *CIT parent studies: CIT02 (NCT00464555), CIT03 (NCT00434850), CIT04 (NCT00468403), CIT05

      (NCT00468442), CIT06 (NCT00468117), and CIT07 (NCT00434811)

      This study will evaluate the safety of infusion of the investigational cord blood units by

      carefully documenting all infusion-related problems.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of this study is to examine the safety of administration of the unlicensed

      investigational NCBP HPC-CORD BLOOD products in a multi-institution setting. Therefore, the

      study will evaluate prospectively the incidence of serious adverse reactions as well as the

      incidence of all infusion related reactions after administration of the unlicensed,

      investigational NCBP CBU.



      Definitions of Infusion-related adverse reactions:



      Mild - Moderate: reactions during or after the infusion of the CB product that require some

      medical intervention but do not affect the overall patient status or outcome.



      Severe: serious, life-threatening or fatal infusion reactions, requiring major medical

      intervention. These include: anaphylactic shock, acute cardiac, pulmonary or renal failure,

      seizures, patient transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, or death within 48 hours of the CB

      infusion. Adverse Reactions will also be classified by grade, according to the Common

      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract.

      Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding to the

      Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor. The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK)

      joined by a juxtamembrane domain. It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells harbor a

      mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and tumour growth.



      Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs. Masitinib

      (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Imatinib is also a

      TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST. It might be associated with side effects

      and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time. Based on pre-clinical and

      clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate in the second

      line treatment of patients with GIST after progression with imatinib.

    <brief_summary>

      Cancer results when undifferentiated cells grow in an uncontrolled manner, crowding out

      normal cells, causing morbidity and ultimately mortality. the cancer stem cell theory

      suggests that most tumors undergo a process of differentiation through which a relatively

      rare cancer stem or progenitor cell (CSC) gives rise to more differentiated populations of

      cells (including transiently amplifying cells) comprising the bulk of the tumor. As a result

      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to

      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key

      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the

      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many

      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in

      esc. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs

      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigator's research program focuses on

      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of

      small molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are

      fundamental to CSCs. Our preliminary results identified a novel Notch associated protein

      NACK that functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Notch. Moreover, Nack is expressed

      in human solid tumors and is required for cell survival and tumor growth in notch -dependent

      tumor cells.



      The investigator's aim is to further interrogate the link between Notch and Nack.



      Specific Aims:



        -  Identify and isolate the cancer stem cell populations from primary chemo naive

           esophageal tumor samples.



        -  Interrogate the status of the Notch,( the link between Notch and Nack), Wnt and Hedghog

           pathways in the chemo naive esophageal tumor as well as in specific cell populations,

           such as the CSC.



        -  Determine the degree of cross-talk between these pathways and which of these pathways

           is essential for the self renewal properties and tumorigenic properties of the esc

           population.



        -  Identify critical targets for therapeutic intervention in CSC populations.

      The ABSORB III RCT is a prospective randomized, single-blind, multi-center trial. It is the

      pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of Absorb™ Bioresorbable Vascular

      Scaffold (BVS).



      The ABSORB III includes additional two trials i.e. ABSORB III PK (pharmacokinetics)

      sub-study and ABSORB IV RCT trial which are maintained under one protocol because both trial

      designs are related, ABSORB IV is the continuation of ABSORB III and the data from ABSORB

      III and ABSORB IV will be pooled to support the ABSORB IV primary endpoint. Both the trials

      will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Absorb BVS.

      ABSORB III RCT:



      A. Primary Objective: The pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of

      Absorb BVS. ABSORB III will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Absorb BVS System

      compared to the XIENCE in the treatment of subjects, including those with diabetes mellitus,

      with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in

      separate epicardial vessels.



      B. Powered Secondary Objectives:



        1. Lead-In Phase Objective: To evaluate the applicability and transferability of the

           didactic Absorb BVS physician training plan to US clinical practice.



           The lead-in phase is a non-randomized, single-arm, open label group of up to 50

           subjects treated with Absorb BVS at up to 35 US sites. The Lead-In phase will

           enroll/register subjects prior to the randomization phase of ABSORB III.



           The Lead-In Phase allows the treatment of up to two de novo native coronary artery

           lesions in different epicardial vessels with reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥ 2.75 mm

           to ≤ 3.25 mm and lesion lengths ≥ 8 to ≤ 14 mm.



        2. Imaging Cohort Objective: To evaluate long-term vascular function and patency of the

           Absorb BVS treated segments compared to XIENCE treated segments in the treatment of

           subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery

           lesions in separate epicardial vessels.



      The imaging cohort-phase is a prospective, randomized (2:1 Absorb BVS to XIENCE),

      single-blind, multi-center trial, registering approximately 200 subjects. This includes 150

      subjects for the angiographic/intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) endpoints analysis and

      approximately 50 subjects for optical coherence tomography (OCT) endpoints analysis. The 200

      subjects are separate from the 2000 subjects included in the primary analysis. Data from two

      powered secondary endpoints from this cohort will support label claims of superiority of

      Absorb BVS as compared to XIENCE specific to vasomotion and late lumen enlargement.



      All other subjects in ABSORB III unless specified will receive treatment of up to two de

      novo native coronary artery lesions in different epicardial vessels with RVD ≥ 2.5 mm to ≤

      3.75 mm and lesion lengths ≤ 24 mm.

    <brief_summary>

      Dendritic Cell vaccine manufactured and partially matured using our standard operating

      procedures, developed in collaboration with the HGG Immuno Group, then administered through

      imiquimod treated skin will be safe and feasible in patients with high grade glioma. This

      will result in anti-tumor immunity that will prolong survival of subjects treated. Study

      treatment will correlate with laboratory evidence of immune activation.

      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of a regimen containing

      elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild®; E/C/F/TDF)

      fixed-dose combination (FDC) versus ritonavir (RTV)-boosted atazanavir (ATV) plus

      emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®; FTC/TDF) in HIV-1 infected,

      antiretroviral treatment-naive adult women.



      This study will consist of two phases: Double-Blinded Treatment Phase (48 weeks) and

      Open-Label Extension (OLE) Phase (48 weeks).



      After 48 weeks of blinded treatment, participants will continue to take blinded study drug

      for 12 weeks and return for an Unblinding Visit at Week 60. Participants who are

      virologically suppressed at Week 48 during the Double-Blinded Treatment Phase will have the

      option to enter the OLE Phase.

    <brief_summary>

      DC vaccine manufactured and partially matured using our standard operating procedures,

      developed in collaboration with the HGG Immuno Group, then administered through imiquimod

      treated skin will be safe and feasible in children with refractory brain tumors. This will

      result in anti-tumor immunity that will prolong survival of subjects treated and results

      will be consistent with the outcomes found for subjects treated by HGG Immuno Group

      investigators. Study treatment will correlate with laboratory evidence of immune activation.

      Correlative studies will also reveal targets in the immune system which can be exploited to

      improve response for patients on successor trials.

    <brief_summary>

      The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib to imatinib in

      patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST) in first line medical treatment.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      GISTs are uncommon visceral sarcomas that arise predominantly in the gastro-intestinal

      tract. Most GIST cells are positive for c-kit (CD117), a cell surface antigen corresponding

      to the Stem Cell Factor (SCF) receptor. The receptor has an intracellular tyrosine kinase

      (TK) joined by a juxtamembrane domain. It is hypothesized that all malignant GIST cells

      harbor a mutation of c-kit, resulting in the activation of c-kit and cell division and

      tumour growth. Drugs that can selectively inhibit TKs are likely to be of benefit in GISTs.

      Masitinib (AB1010) is a TK inhibitor, selectively and effectively inhibiting c-kit. Imatinib

      is also a TK inhibitor indicated in the treatment of GIST. It might be associated with side

      effects and patients might develop a resistance to treatment over time. Based on

      pre-clinical and clinical studies, masitinib (AB1010) can be considered as a good candidate

      in the first line treatment of patients with GIST.

      This randomized phase III trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in

      treating young patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is likely to

      come back or spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of

      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more

      than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving the drugs in different doses and in

      different combinations may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine if the administration of post-Induction age-adjusted intrathecal triple

      therapy (ITT) on a Modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (MBFM) interim maintenance (IM)

      high-dose methotrexate (IMHDM) backbone will improve 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of

      children with high-risk (HR) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to age-adjusted

      intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX).



      II. To determine, in a randomized fashion, if the cyclophosphamide + etoposide containing

      regimen (Experimental Arm 1) will improve the 4-year DFS of children, adolescents, and young

      adults with very high-risk (VHR) B-ALL compared to a modified MBFM-IMHDM regimen that

      contains a second IM (Control Arm).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of post-Induction age-adjusted ITT compared to

      age-adjusted IT MTX in children with HR B-ALL.



      II. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control

      Arm in children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL.



      III. To determine whether a single-arm, modified Induction with limited anthracycline

      exposure and post-Induction therapy regimen with MBFM-IMIDM and reduced vincristine

      (vincristine sulfate)/steroid pulse frequency and enhanced supportive care in children with

      Down syndrome (DS) and HR B-ALL will result in a &gt;= 65% 5-year DFS and &lt; 10% Induction

      mortality.



      IV. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of MBFM-IMIDM in children with DS and HR

      B-ALL.



      V. To estimate overall survival (OS) rates both overall and by regimen a) for HR B-ALL and

      b) VHR B-ALL patients.



      VI. To determine the incidence of osteonecrosis (ON), defined by magnetic resonance (MR)

      imaging, and to characterize the natural history of clinically silent ON in children,

      adolescents, and young adults 10 years of age and greater and to assess the role of drugs

      (i.e., asparaginase and methotrexate) in addition to corticosteroids, in the risk for

      development of ON.



      VII. To determine if the prevalence of cognitive deficits measured by CogState, in children

      (ages 6 to 11 years) with HR- and VHR B-ALL at 1 year off therapy, is significantly higher

      than the normative population (&gt; 14%) in the following domains: working memory, executive

      function, visual motor, processing speed, and visual attention.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine if the reduction of minimal residual disease (MRD) from end-Induction to

      end-Consolidation is greater for children, adolescents, and young adults with VHR B-ALL

      receiving Experimental Arm 1 compared to the Control Arm.

    <brief_summary>

      Background/Rationale: Cognitive problems are a common symptom in individuals with Multiple

      Sclerosis (MS). Treatment options are limited, and there is a pressing need for new

      interventions to treat MS-related cognitive impairment. Glucose (a type of sugar) is used to

      fuel the cells of the healthy brain. For people with neurological conditions such as MS,

      glucose is not converted into energy as efficiently as it would be in a healthy brain, which

      can lead to a decrease in cognitive function. Caprylic Triglyceride may work to bypass this

      problem by providing an alternative energy source that is metabolized in the liver and used

      by the brain.



      Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of 90 days of caprylic triglyceride on

      cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.



      Design: Randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of 158 subjects.



      Outcome: Change in Total Learning (Trials 1-5) on the California Verbal Learning Test-2nd

      Edition-(CVLT-II) AND Change in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (at day 90

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Patients with all types of MS (Relapsing Remitting, Secondary Progressive, or Primary

      Progressive) are eligible to participate. Participants will undergo detailed cognitive

      assessment before initiating treatment and again after 90 days of treatment, to determine

      whether Caprylic Triglyceride demonstrates a benefit over placebo.



      Dosage: 40 gram packet orally once a day Duration of Treatment: 90 days



      Analyses: Interim analyses will be conducted after 72 subjects have completed the trial and

      objective STOP criteria for efficacy and futility have been defined in the protocol. Final

      analyses will be an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis to evaluate each of the primary aims.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the 1064nm Neodymium yttrium

      aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (Laser Genesis, Cutera TM) in the treatment of surgical scar

      after direct brow lift.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Patients who undergo a direct brow lift may participate in this study. Participants will

      receive laser treatment on one of the two surgical wounds (side of treatment will be chosen

      randomly by an independent source). Treatment parameters will be 500 spots and 10-14

      megajoules (mJ) depending on skin type. The opposite side brow scar will not be treated

      until 1 month after the study is completed (if the patient elects to treat the contralateral

      brow after study completion this will be done at no charge to the patient). This treatment

      will be given at 2-4 week intervals for 6 treatments. Photographs will be taken at each

      visit, and they will be assessed based on different parameters by an examiner, as well as

      judged by the patient based on overall appearance.

    <brief_summary>

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in

      chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,

      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether

      radiation therapy is more effective when given together with chemotherapy or alone after

      surgery in treating salivary gland tumors.



      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying radiation therapy with or without

      chemotherapy to see how well it works in treating patients with high-risk malignant salivary

      gland tumors that have been removed by surgery.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        -  Determine the feasibility of conducting a cooperative group prospective clinical trial

           in patients with resected malignant salivary gland tumors.



        -  Acquire preliminary efficacy data comparing postoperative radiotherapy alone to

           concurrent chemotherapy and radiation using weekly cisplatin.



      Secondary



        -  Compare the acute toxicities of these 2 adjuvant treatments.



        -  Compare long-term efficacy results at 5 years and late treatment-related adverse events

           in patients receiving postoperative radiation to those receiving concurrent

           chemoradiation.



        -  Investigate quality of life and patient-reported outcomes in patients enrolled in the

           study.



        -  Identify the histopathology and tumor marker expression from patients enrolled on this

           trial and assemble a tissue bank for future correlative studies.



        -  Establish a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) baseline database for salivary

           gland malignancies to serve as a resource for future exploration of innovative and/or

           targeted approaches for this disease.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology

      (high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma vs salivary duct carcinoma vs high-grade

      adenocarcinoma) and nodal status (N0 vs N1-3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment

      arms.



        -  Arm I: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or

           intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for 6-6.5 weeks. Patients also

           receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 during

           radiotherapy.



        -  Arm II: Patients undergo 3D-CRT or IMRT as in arm I. Tissue and blood samples may be

           collected for translational research studies. Patients may complete quality-of-life

           assessments periodically.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months,

      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a prospective non-blinded case series involving the acquisition of a pair production

      PET/CT as soon as possible after an already performed Y-90 Sirspheres treatment of hepatic

      malignancy. It will be performed in addition to the standard Brehmsstralung SPECT scan. The

      sequence of the two scans in each case (PET/CT vs SPECT) will be determined by availability

      of the scanners at the time. However, it is intended that both be acquired on the day of the

      Y-90 treatment.



      The length of subject participation will be one year.



      The measures used will be mostly qualitative in nature, and will include:



        -  Degree of correlation with expected vs. achieved tumor coverage by the treatment



        -  Degree of correlation between treatment distribution depicted by Brehmsstrahlung scans

           vs. the Internal Pair Production PET/CT scans, to include an assessment/comparison of

           the precision of anatomic localization achieved by the two modalities.



        -  Determination of Tumor/Background ratios, and correlating with planned dose



        -  Detection of non-target embolization, where applicable, and qualitative comparison

           between the two modalities as to the conspicuity of the abnormality



      Qualitative methods will be used by the analysis of the obtained PET/CT images and comparing

      them to the Brehmsstralung SPECT images as previously described.



      Tumor to background ratios will be generated and used as a metric for correlation with

      planned/administered dose and also with CT and/or FDG PET scans pre or post treatment, if

      available. For CT, the RECIST criteria will be used to calculate volumes of necrosis, would

      be used for the correlation. For FDG PET scans, SUV would be used for correlation.

    <brief_summary>

      This study is to test a therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAX™) in HIV-1 infected subjects. The

      safety and immune responses will be studied in vaccine recipients. The anti-viral effect of

      HIVAX vaccine will be monitored during a 12-week treatment interruption phase.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the

      safety and the immunogenicity of two doses of a replication defective HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAX™)

      in subjects receiving stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) who have an HIV-1

      RNA &lt;50 copies/ml and CD4 cell count &gt;500 cells/mm3. Following the randomized

      placebo-controlled vaccination phase subjects who received active vaccine and who meet

      eligibility will undergo a 12-week analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption followed

      by reinstitution of antiretroviral therapy (or continued interruption) with follow up

      through week 48.

    <brief_summary>

      This study is being conducted to characterize the way leg wounds respond to a new type of

      wound dressing, compared to wounds in patients who are not using the new dressing. The

      investigators will collect wound fluid for biochemical analysis, and they will measure the

      wound healing that occurs with and without the new dressing.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Abnormal wound healing is characterized by prolonged inflammation and excess degradation of

      the extracellular matrix through the activity of proteinases and other enzymes. Wound fluids

      can provide biochemical information about the healing status of chronic wounds and the

      effects of wound treatments. In this study the investigators will obtain samples of wound

      fluid and measure healing in wounds randomized to receive the novel dressing or a control.

      The findings will be compared between the two groups.

      H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute will be the Sunshine Project

      Coordinator, but will not be recruiting locally.



      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of escalating doses of

      metformin on a backbone of vincristine, irinotecan and temozolomide (VIT) in children with

      recurrent and refractory solid tumors.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Metformin is an oral anti-diabetes medication that activates AMP-activated protein kinase

      (AMPK). Recent data from in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as epidemiologic

      retrospective analyses, suggest that metformin has anti-cancer activity. Vincristine,

      irinotecan, and temozolomide (VIT) is a combination of chemotherapeutic agents that have

      different mechanisms of action as well as disparate side effect profiles. Two recent phase 1

      trials have demonstrated that this regimen is safe and well-tolerated in children with

      relapsed and refractory solid tumors.

    <brief_summary>

      The primary goal of the Phase III TWiTCH trial is to compare 24 months of alternative

      therapy (hydroxyurea) to standard therapy (transfusions) for pediatric subjects with sickle

      cell anemia and abnormally high (≥200 cm/sec) Transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities, who

      currently receive chronic transfusions to reduce the risk of primary stroke. For the

      alternative treatment regimen (hydroxyurea) to be declared non-inferior to the standard

      treatment regimen (transfusions), after adjusting for baseline differences, the

      hydroxyurea-treated group must have a mean TCD velocity similar to that observed with

      transfusion prophylaxis.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Despite the clear results of the STOP and the follow-up STOP II trials, the use of chronic

      erythrocyte transfusions for primary stroke prevention in children with Sickle Cell Anemia

      (SCA) remains controversial for many practicing hematologists, as well as for patients and

      families. Transfusions have proven clinical efficacy in preventing first stroke in children

      with SCA and abnormal TCD velocities, but their indefinite use may still be difficult to

      justifY.



      The risk of transfusion acquired iron overload is now recognized as a serious consequence of

      chronic erythrocyte transfusions in children with SCA. After one to two years of monthly

      transfusions, virtually every patient will have excess hepatic iron deposition that warrants

      intervention with chelation therapy. The effectiveness of iron chelation has not yet been

      realized, despite the availability of the oral chelator deferasirox (Exjade®), due to its

      lack of palatability and increasing recognition of serious drug-related toxicities including

      renal and hepatic dysfunction. Simply put, indefinite erythrocyte transfusions cannot be

      viewed as adequate and acceptable long-term therapy for primary stroke prevention in SCA.

      There is an urgent need to develop an equivalent effective alternative therapy for the

      prevention of primary stroke in children with SCA, specifically one that better manages iron

      overload and improves quality of life.

    <brief_summary>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention that involves the

      medication naltrexone, will reduce drinking and improve health outcomes in women with HIV

      infection and hazardous drinking. Our central hypotheses are that, compared to women who

      receive placebo (sugar pill containing no medicine), women who receive naltrexone will have

      decreased rates of hazardous drinking, improved HIV medication adherence, less rapid disease

      progression, and reduced sexual risk behavior. The study design will involve 240

      HIV-infected women with hazardous drinking, who will be recruited from HIV clinics,

      neighborhoods and referrals in Miami, Florida.



      Eligible women will receive either a daily pill containing naltrexone (50mg) or an

      identical-appearing placebo for four months. All participants will receive encouragement and

      feedback related to their drinking regardless of medication assignment. The study

      participants will be assessed at two, four and seven months after enrollment. The proposed

      work is innovative because pharmacologic treatment for alcohol has not been evaluated in

      HIV-infected women. If our hypotheses are confirmed, the study findings would transform the

      approach to hazardous drinking within clinics serving HIV-infected women.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a

      treatment program for hazardous drinking, delivered within HIV-clinic outpatient settings,

      that involves oral naltrexone. The central hypothesis is that women participating in the

      treatment program will have decreased rates of hazardous drinking and improved clinical and

      behavioral health outcomes that are associated with hazardous drinking. The investigators

      have formulated this hypotheses based on the existing literature, the preliminary data and

      the clinical experience. The investigators theorize that women who receive an alcohol

      treatment intervention will be less likely to have "at risk" drinking behavior 6-months

      after enrollment, compared to women who received similar assessments but no formal treatment

      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that 4-months after enrollment, women who

      receive an alcohol treatment intervention will have improved adherence to HIV antiretroviral

      therapy, improved CD4 cell counts, reduced HIV viral load, and reduced risky sexual

      behavior, compared to women who receive similar assessments but no formal intervention.



      The investigators will recruit 240 women from one site in Miami, Florida. Of those 240 women

      120 will receive naltrexone and the others will receive placebo. Study participants will

      take the medication for 4 months but the investigators will follow them for 7 months. At

      baseline, 2 months, 4 months and 7 months, the investigators will administer study

      questionnaires and assess their liver enzymes, CD4 count and viral load. The investigators

      will also follow them up at months 1 and 3 to reinforce the medication intake and to assess

      for any possible side effects.



      New treatment options are available, but their impact on hazardous drinking has not yet been

      evaluated among HIV-infected women, many of whom are poor, minorities, or who have

      associated mental health or substance abuse problems. Delivery of therapeutic interventions

      must be improved in order to reduce hazardous drinking in women with HIV/AIDS. The proposed

      research is significant because the therapy will be offered within HIV clinic settings and

      will potentially improve the health of a population that is significantly undertreated. In

      addition to determining the effectiveness of an alcohol treatment intervention, the

      investigators will also identify key barriers and facilitators associated with adherence to

      pharmacologic treatment for alcohol in women with hazardous drinking. The findings will

      directly affect the type and quality of care for hazardous drinking in this subset of

      HIV-infected individuals and will inform both primary and secondary prevention efforts.

    <brief_summary>

      The BABY HUG Treatment Study was designed to see if treatment with the drug hydroxyurea

      (also called HU) in children with sickle cell disease could prevent organ damage, especially

      in the spleen and kidneys. There was also a chance that treatment could prevent painful

      crises, lung disease, stroke, and blood infection.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The current observational trial, Follow-Up Study II (designated FUS II) includes enhanced

      neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations for this very well

      characterized cohort of subjects. Measures of spleen and renal function and markers of DNA

      damage will continue to be collected. Assessment of other target organs in sickle cell

      disease including pulmonary and cardiac function will be performed in addition to evaluation

      of developmental aspects of SCD and potential HU toxicity.

    <brief_summary>

      Part 1 - Dose-Ranging. Part 1 will evaluate the (1) safety and tolerability and (2) efficacy

      (antiretroviral activity) of 4 doses of doravirine (MK-1439) compared with efavirenz, when

      each is given in combination with TRUVADA® for at least 24 weeks in approximately 200

      participants. A single dose of doravirine will be selected for further study after all

      participants complete the Week 24 visit in Part 1. Participants receiving any dose of

      doravirine in Part 1 will be switched to the selected doravirine dose and continue in the

      study for up to 96 weeks.



      Part 2 - Selected Dose. Part 2 will be initiated after the doravirine dose has been selected

      as indicated above for Part 1. Approximately 120 additional participants will be randomized

      in 1:1 ratio to the selected dose of doravirine or efavirenz, each in combination with

      TRUVADA® for 96 weeks of blinded treatment. Part 2 will evaluate the safety of the selected

      dose compared with efavirenz, particularly with regard to central nervous system adverse

      events (CNS events).



      The hypothesis tested in this study is that MK-1439 at the final dose selected is superior

      to efavirenz, each given in combination with TRUVADA®, as measured by the proportion of

      participants with CNS events by Week 8. If superiority is established at Week 8, the same

      hypothesis will be tested for Week 24.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of belimumab

      in adult patients with active lupus nephritis.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Study participants receive standard therapy (induction and maintenance) for lupus nephritis

      in addition to receiving either placebo (no active medicine) or belimumab. Induction therapy

      starts before the first dose of study drug (belimumab or placebo). Maintenance therapy

      begins after completion of induction therapy and continues for the remainder of the study.

      Participants receive study drug throughout the entire study, during both induction and

      maintenance periods. The controlled period of the study is 104 weeks. The random assignment

      in this study is "1 to 1" which means you have an equal chance of receiving treatment with

      belimumab or placebo. Participants who successfully complete the 104-week study may enter

      into a 6-month open-label extension. All participants in the open-label extension receive

      belimumab.

      study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the ST Monitoring Feature in the

      Fortify® ST, Fortify Assura® ST, and Ellipse® ST family of devices, as well as any future St

      Jude Medical devices with the same ST Monitoring Feature capabilities. Effectiveness of the

      device will be evaluated by analyzing the sensitivity of the ST Monitoring Feature to detect

      clinical events. In addition, safety of the ST Monitoring Feature will be evaluated by

      demonstrating a low percentage of patients with false positive events.

    <brief_summary>

      Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting women of childbearing

      age. Poor pregnancy outcomes are increased in these women and their children. The proposed

      studies will increase our knowledge on multiple levels to improve care and reduce adverse

      outcomes in these mothers and children. An overall goal of this study is to establish the

      relationship between antiepileptic drug exposure and outcomes in the mother and child as

      well as describe and explain the variability in antiepileptic drug exposure and response.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      There is a compelling need for prospective, properly controlled studies in women with

      epilepsy (WWE) during pregnancy to improve maternal and child outcomes. The proposed

      investigations are pertinent to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

      Epilepsy Research Benchmarks and will address multiple gaps in our knowledge noted by the

      recent American Academy of Neurology guidelines. This multicenter investigation will employ

      a prospective, observational, parallel-group, cohort design with an established research

      team.



      The specific aims are to:



        1. Determine if women with epilepsy have increased seizures during pregnancy and delineate

           the contributing factors;



        2. Determine if C-section rate is increased in women with epilepsy and delineate

           contributing factors;



        3. Determine if women with epilepsy have an increased risk for depression during pregnancy

           and post-partum period and characterize risks factors;



        4. Determine the long-term effects of in utero antiepileptic drug exposure on verbal

           intellectual abilities and other neurobehavioral outcomes in the children of women with

           epilepsy;



        5. Determine if small for gestation age and other adverse neonatal outcomes are increased

           in children of women with epilepsy;



        6. Determine if breastfeeding when taking antiepileptic drugs impairs the child's verbal

           intellectual and other cognitive abilities.



      An overall goal of the proposed research is to establish the relationship between

      antiepileptic drug exposure and outcomes in the mother and child as well as describe and

      explain the variability in antiepileptic drug exposure and response.



      Anticonvulsant blood levels (ABLs) and area-under-the-concentration-time-curves (AUCs) will

      be used as direct measures of drug exposure. The results will enable clinicians to

      prospectively calculate individual dosing regimens for the mother in order to optimize

      dosing and limit unnecessary drug exposure to the child. In addition, genetic samples will

      be collected, which will provide a valuable resource for future pharmacogenetics studies to

      further delineate individual variability across patients.

    <brief_summary>

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether using bevacizumab (Avastin®) is both safe

      and effective at decreasing the likelihood of a high-risk corneal graft rejection. Patients

      who are "high-risk" for rejection have blood vessels growing from the white of the eye into

      the cornea (clear, front region of the eye). The medication is used at the time of surgery

      and in the weeks following surgery. Participants have a 50/50 chance at receiving the active

      study medication or a placebo medication.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), in

      preventing blood vessels that often occur after a corneal transplantation which are

      considered at "high-risk" for rejection. In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft

      rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant. It is hoped that this treatment

      will increase the chances of corneal graft survival.



      The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc). It

      works by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor

      (VEGF). VEGF is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood

      vessel formation. When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and

      growth of new blood vessels. Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which

      can worsen the prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk

      for rejection.

    <brief_summary>

      Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) is an important morbidity affecting premature infants and can

      have considerable effects on neurodevelopmental outcome.



      The investigators showed that preterm infants with severe ICH have decreased cerebral

      oxygenation several weeks after the hemorrhage. The mechanisms involved in this state of

      decreased cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants and the effects on cerebral function are

      unknown.



      This longitudinal observation study will evaluate physiologic parameters to determine trends

      in cerebral oxygenation and function in preterm infants with ICH in comparison to infants

      without ICH.

      RATIONALE: Collecting and studying tissue samples from patients with cancer in the

      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify

      biomarkers related to cancer.



      PURPOSE: This research trial studies collecting tissue samples from patients with

      HIV-related malignancies.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



        -  To obtain high-quality, clinically annotated tissue from patients with human

           immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 malignancy.



        -  To study clinical, genetic, and immunologic parameters that have prognostic

           significance and/or are involved in the initiation and progression of HIV-1

           malignancies, including complete genomic sequence determination of HIV-associated

           diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, lung cancer, anal cancer, and cervical cancer.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.



      Patients undergo tumor, lymph node, bone marrow, or skin biopsy, and peripheral blood

      mononuclear cells collection. Samples are submitted to the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC)

      Biorepository and transferred to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR). Samples are

      then analyzed by the Genome Science Center of British Columbia (GSC-BC) and the HIV+ Tumor

      Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP) for full genomic sequencing analysis that may

      include, but are not limited to, array-based gene expression profiling, comparative genome

      hybridization, and single nucleotide polymorphism studies by flow cytometry, cytogenetics,

      and molecular studies. Patients' clinical data, demographics, and treatment given are also

      collected prospectively in order to record treatment outcome and toxicity.



      Patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years for data-reporting purposes.

             enrollment:



               -  Absence of sufficient diagnostic tumor-biopsy tissue material to meet the

                  protocol requirements for baseline specimen submission (minimum specimen size of

                  10 x 10 x 2 mm); repeat tumor biopsy will not be performed solely to meet the

                  protocol specimen-collection requirements



               -  Participants whose biopsies, for the purpose of this protocol, show a diagnosis

                  of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia

    <brief_summary>

      The specific aims of this study are: 1) to replicate the data that following ten days of

      massage therapy, preterm infants show greater daily weight gain and are discharged from the

      hospital earlier than the controls, thus demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of the

      intervention; 2) to test a model on two potential underlying mechanisms for weight gain

      including a) enhanced vagal activity leading to greater gastric motility, higher levels of

      insulin, IGF-1, and oxytocin and lower cortisol levels in the massage versus the control

      infants at the end of the study; and/or b) increased physical activity and its associated

      increase in heart rate oxygen consumption and temperature leading to greater weight gain.

      These pathways (vagal activity and physical activity) will be tested by path analyses.

      Determining underlying mechanisms for the massage therapy/weight gain relationship is a

      critical process required by the neonatology community for massage therapy to be adopted as

      a standard neonatal intensive care unit.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      A number of studies have documented an average of 47% greater weight gain in preterm

      neonates following massage therapy. Our currently funded study suggests that massage therapy

      increases vagal activity, oxytocin, and IGF-1. In the proposed continuation of this study

      preemies would be provided daily massages three times a day for 10 days, as in our

      previously successful protocol. To determine potential mechanisms that may underlie the

      massage therapy/weight gain relationship we will continue to assess vagal activity and assay

      insulin, oxytocin, IGF-1 and cortisol as well as gastric motility. We have added an

      alternative potential pathway for the massage therapy/weight gain relationship. In this

      expanded model, activity level and the related measures of heart rate, oxygen consumption

      (based on a formula calculated from heart rate) and temperature mediate the effects of

      massage therapy on weight gain. A larger sample will be recruited so that we can have the

      power needed to test our model of the potential mechanisms underlying the weight gain from

      preterm infant massage. For the current application, 120 preterm infants with common medical

      complications of prematurity, who are medically stable and residing in the intermediate care

      ("grower") nursery, will be assigned to groups based on a random stratification on the

      following variables: gender, gestational age, birthweight, days in the NICU, and study entry

      weight. One hundred twenty infants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) ten

      days of massage therapy (n=60), or 2) standard treatment (n=60). Within-subjects and

      between-groups analyses will focus on physiological (heart rate, vagal tone, gastric

      motility, and temperature), biochemical (insulin, oxytocin, IGF-1 and cortisol) and

      behavioral variables (activity level).

    <brief_summary>

      HIV-infected people have an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). The

      standard course of treatment for TB is 6 to 9 months of isoniazid (INH). A shorter course of

      treatment may be as effective and potentially increase treatment adherence. This study will

      compare the safety and effectiveness of a 4-week regimen of rifapentine (RPT) plus INH

      versus a standard 9-month regimen of INH in HIV-infected people who are at risk of

      developing active TB.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2009 there were 9.4 million new cases

      of TB, and 1.68 million people died as a result of TB. Among new TB cases, 1.1 million

      occurred in people who were HIV-coinfected, and 35% of TB deaths were among HIV-coinfected

      individuals. In Africa, TB is the leading AIDS-related opportunistic infection. Latent TB

      infection occurs when people are infected with the bacteria that cause TB, but they do not

      have any symptoms of TB infection. Latent TB can develop into active TB, and HIV-infected

      people have an increased risk of progressing from latent TB to active TB. INH is a

      medication that is prescribed for people with latent TB to help prevent active TB from

      developing. The standard INH treatment regimen is 6 to 9 months; a shorter treatment regimen

      may prove to be as effective and may improve adherence. The purpose of this study is to

      compare the safety and effectiveness of a 4-week daily regimen of RPT plus INH to a standard

      9-month daily INH regimen for TB prevention in HIV-infected individuals.



      This study will enroll HIV-infected people who do not have evidence of active TB but who are

      at high risk of developing active TB. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive RPT

      and INH once a day for 4 weeks or INH once a day for 9 months. All participants will receive

      pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with each dose of INH to help prevent possible side effects. Study

      visits will occur at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 36. At select study

      visits, participants will undergo a physical exam, clinical assessment, blood collection,

      and a chest radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) scan (if needed). Some participants

      will have their blood stored for future testing. Follow-up study visits will occur every 12

      weeks starting at Week 48 and will continue for 3 years after the last participant is

      enrolled.

      This randomized phase II-R/III trial studies gemcitabine hydrochloride with or without

      erlotinib hydrochloride followed by the same chemotherapy regimen with or without radiation

      therapy and capecitabine or fluorouracil in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that

      was removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride,

      capecitabine, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,

      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from

      spreading. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of

      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor

      cells. Giving chemotherapy together with or without erlotinib hydrochloride and/or radiation

      therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet

      known whether chemotherapy is more effective when given with or without erlotinib

      hydrochloride and/or radiation therapy in treating pancreatic cancer.

    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine whether the addition of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) to gemcitabine

      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) adjuvant chemotherapy shows a signal for improved survival as

      compared to gemcitabine alone following R0 or R1 resection of head of pancreas

      adenocarcinoma (including adenocarcinoma of the head, neck, and uncinate process). (Phase

      II-R) II. To determine whether the use of concurrent fluoropyrimidine and radiotherapy

      following adjuvant gemcitabine based chemotherapy or non-gemcitabine based chemotherapy such

      as modified fluorouracil-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin regimen (FOLFIRINOX) further

      enhances survival for such patients who are without evidence of progressive disease after 5

      months of adjuvant chemotherapy. (Phase III)



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate disease-free survival of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and

      concurrent fluoropyrimidine for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma who

      are disease free after 5 months of adjuvant chemotherapy.



      II. To evaluate disease-free survival of standard adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy with and

      without erlotinib for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma.



      III. To evaluate adverse events with and without erlotinib for patients with resected head

      of pancreas adenocarcinoma.



      IV. To evaluate adverse events of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy

      and concurrent fluoropyrimidine for patients with resected head of pancreas adenocarcinoma

      who are disease free after adjuvant chemotherapy.



      V. To evaluate preoperative cross-sectional imaging of the primary head of pancreas

      adenocarcinoma in order to determine the frequency with which objective criteria of

      resectability are present.



      VI. To determine if patients reporting low baseline fatigue, as measured by the Functional

      Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue, predicts survival and to explore

      correlations between baseline fatigue, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement

      Information System (PROMIS), and survival.



      OUTLINE: Patients without disease progression after treatment in arm I or II are randomized

      to 1 of 2 additional treatment arms (arm III or IV).



      ARM I: Patients receive either gemcitabine hydrochloride or allowable combination

      chemotherapy per standard of care for 5 months.



      ARM II (closed to accrual 4/2/14): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously

      (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily

      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM III: Patients receive the same treatment as in arm I for 1 month.



      ARM IV: Patients receive the same treatment as in arm I for 1 month. Beginning within 7-21

      days after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy (3-dimensional

      conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy) 5 days per week for 5.5 weeks

      (28 fractions). During radiotherapy, patients receive either capecitabine PO twice daily

      (BID) 5 days per week or fluorouracil IV continuously for 5.5 weeks or until radiotherapy is

      completed.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <brief_summary>

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the incidence of progressive

      multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in natalizumab-treated participants who do not have

      detectable antibodies to John Cunningham virus (JCV) (antibody negative) is lower than in

      participants who have detectable antibodies to JCV (antibody positive).



      The secondary objectives of this study are to: Estimate the incidence of PML in

      natalizumab-treated participants who are anti-JCV antibody negative and anti-JCV antibody

      positive, based on a meta-analysis of data obtained from this study and other data sources;

      Define the prevalence of anti-JCV antibody in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) participants

      receiving natalizumab within the TYSABRI Outreach: United Commitment to Health (TOUCH)

      Prescribing Program; Determine changes in anti-JCV antibody status over time.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      No treatment is provided in this observational, longitudinal cohort study. Study population

      will consist of United States (US) participants with relapsing MS receiving commercial

      natalizumab. There are no study-mandated visits. Serum samples will be collected during

      routine patient care or follow-up visits and will be sent to a central laboratory for

      analysis (presence of anti-JCV antibody), and remaining serum aliquots will be stored for

      future natalizumab and PML research. Additional samples will be collected at participating

      sites from participants who qualify and consent to participate in focused sampling group

      (participants who are anti-JCV antibody positive at any time point AND have received ≥12

      infusions of natalizumab, whether or not they have a history of immunosuppressant use).

      These samples will be stored for future natalizumab and PML research.

      A prospective, randomized multicenter study of subjects with a high-risk of having a

      myocardial infarction (MI) due to acute coronary syndrome or bypass surgery.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      There are over one million acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) each year in the United States

      with more than 400,000 of these resulting in death. Early identification of AMI, and prompt

      treatment has been shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes. Experimental and

      clinical studies have shown that most of the irreversible damage to the myocardium occurs

      during the first two hours after coronary occlusion. Milavetz et al. demonstrated that

      successful reperfusion therapy within two hours was associated with the greatest degree of

      myocardial salvage. According to Boersma, et al., restoration of flow, regardless of the

      method used, can abort infarction within the first 30 minutes after coronary occlusion, and

      the benefit of fibrinolytic therapy compared with placebo is considerably higher in patients

      treated within 2 hours after symptom onset than in those treated later.2 Further, evidence

      exists that expeditious restoration of flow in the obstructed infarct artery after the onset

      of symptoms in patients with the most severe type of MI, ST elevation MI (STEMI) is a key

      determinant of short and long-term outcomes regardless of whether reperfusion is

      accomplished by fibrinolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). , , Therefore, the

      early arrival at the hospital for a reliable diagnosis and initiation of treatment is

      paramount to improve the outcomes of myocardial infarction. However, despite efforts at

      educating the public over the past decade, the mean time from AMI symptom onset to arrival

      at a hospital for treatment has remained, disappointingly, at 2.5-3.0 hours.1,4,7



      The largest proportion of the total pre-hospital delay is the interval between the onset of

      symptoms and the decision to seek medical treatment. Finnegan et al. described that the

      reasons for delay in seeking medical evaluation generally stem from patient misconceptions

      about symptom experience, expectations, and attribution. In many cases, patients expect the

      type of heart attack that they often see in movies or on television: the kind of crushing

      chest pain that drops a person to the ground. The reality is that many heart attacks are

      much "quieter," causing only mild chest pain or discomfort or other symptoms such as

      shortness of breath or diaphoresis.



      If patients would take action during the first hour following symptom onset, many lives and

      significant cost could be saved. It is technically possible to monitor EKGs and detect an

      acute infarction, even if the patient is unaware that he or she is experiencing a heart

      attack. However, currently available systems have limitations in the home environment.

      Twelve lead EKG systems require a clinically trained individual to place them. Holter

      monitors suffer from limitations in the ability to detect ST deviation due to low compliance

      and are limited in practice to 24 to 72 hours of monitoring. Systems using surface leads are

      all subject to noise and other artifacts from patient movement and body orientation,

      particularly if the patient is ambulatory.



      A potentially ideal solution is to implant a device that measures heart signals from inside

      the heart and will alert the patient when it detects electrogram characteristics set by the

      physician as worthy of medical evaluation.

    <brief_summary>

      -  Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV), identified by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging

           (MRSI) is different from the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) used for radiation dose

           delivery in the treatment of brain tumors.



        -  If MTV &gt; CTV, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in volumes (cc) is

           related to worse clinical outcome. Furthermore, in case of local recurrence, the lesion

           is located in the MTV area that is outside of the CTV.



        -  Alternatively, if CTV &gt; MTV, then the difference in volumes is related to higher

           treatment toxicity.

    <brief_summary>

      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early

      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in adult life. This has been related to low

      nephron mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during

      the perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease

      include proteinuria, excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and

      supplemental high calorie feedings. The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those

      infants who are at risk for future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that

      the investigators might intervene to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The

      objective of this clinical trial is to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal

      kidney function and size in infants born preterm during the first 2 years of life. This will

      be done through the use of standard serum and urine markers as well as non-invasive

      ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of this clinical trial is that a subgroup of

      patients born preterm and of low birth weight will demonstrate early markers of kidney

      injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and low kidney size. This hypothesis

      has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data from our group studying this question

      retrospectively in older children born prematurely who have developed overt kidney disease.

      The rationale for the proposed research is to develop early serum and demographic markers of

      pre-clinical kidney disease so that early intervention can occur. The proposed clinical

      trial is innovative because it will investigate the risk factors for kidney dysfunction at a

      pre-clinical stage with the idea of gaining more knowledge regarding therapeutic

      interventions. In addition, the study will assess serum cystatin C as a surrogate test for

      glomerular filtration rate which could indicate worsening kidney function at an earlier

      stage than serum creatinine.



      The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify at-risk patients for

      future renal impairment and to prospectively monitor the persistence of proteinuria and its

      effect on kidney function in the short term.

      Objectives and Hypotheses:



      Infants born preterm and of low birth weight are known to be at increased risk for early

      onset of cardiovascular and renal disease in later life. This has been related to low

      nephron mass due to inadequate or early termination of glomerulogenesis in utero and during

      the perinatal period. Risks for subsequent development of hypertension and kidney disease

      include excessive weight gain during early life with insulin resistance and supplemental

      high calorie feedings.



      Specific Aims The long-term goal is for early diagnosis of those infants who are at risk for

      future development of hypertension and kidney disease so that investigators might intervene

      to potentially avert progression to adult disease. The objective of this clinical trial is

      to acquire data on the natural history of neonatal kidney function and size in infants born

      preterm during the first year of life. This will be done through the use of standard serum

      and urine markers as well as non-invasive ultrasound technology. The central hypothesis of

      this clinical trial is that a subgroup of patients born preterm will demonstrate early

      markers of kidney injury including elevated serum cystatin C, proteinuria and hypertension.

      This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data from the group studying

      this question retrospectively in older children born prematurely who have developed overt

      kidney disease. The rationale for the proposed research is to develop early serum and

      demographic markers of pre-clinical kidney disease so that early intervention may occur.



      The investigators expect to test the central hypothesis and to achieve the objectives of

      this application by pursuing the following 3 specific aims:



        1. Identify risk factors associated with proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hypertension and

           kidney function in preterm infants.



             1. Intra-uterine and perinatal factors: Based on preliminary data, the working

                hypothesis is that infants born preterm have a nephron deficit that predisposes

                them to hypertension and subclinial and clinical kidney disease during their

                lifetimes that may have origins in the perinatal period.



             2. Acquired factors: The investigators postulate that early perinatal stressors and

                exposures such as nephrotoxic antibiotics and vasoactive medications as well as

                high calorie nutritional supplements may pre-dispose to renal disease in this

                vulnerable population.



             3. Ethnic differences among Caucasians, African Americans, Caribbean Blacks and

                Hispanics. Based on preliminary data, the working hypothesis is that there will be

                a statistically significant difference among the ethnic groups.



        2. Observe the natural history of proteinuria, microalbuminuria, hypertension and kidney

           function in preterm infants during the first year of life. Based on preliminary data in

           older infants and children, the working hypothesis is that the degree of proteinuria

           and microalbuminuria is a reflection of kidney injury and dysfunction that correlates

           with ongoing disease progression. The investigators postulate that a subset of patients

           will have persistent manifestations of kidney disease after the perinatal period,

           especially those with nephrotoxic exposures and high calorie nutritional supplements.



        3. Establish serum cystatin C as a sensitive test to measure kidney function in preterm

           infants. The investigators hypothesize that cord blood and early serum cystatin C will

           be more predictive of kidney function than serum creatinine in preterm infants.



      Study Design. This is a single-center case-controlled prospective observational study with

      the rationale of evaluating parameters of renal function including proteinuria,

      microalbuminuria and cystatin C in preterm infants and associating this with kidney size and

      blood pressure during the first 6 years of life. Demographics including race, gender and

      growth will provide important perspectives relative to formula and/or breast feeding

      with/without high calorie supplements during the first year.

      H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute will be the Sunshine Project

      Coordinator, but will not be recruiting locally.



      The purpose of the trial is to study the clinical and biological effects of metformin in

      combination with standard systemic chemotherapy in a disease (relapsed ALL) that has a

      dismal outcome, as well as to do a dose escalation study to find the Maximum Tolerated Dose

      (MTD) of metformin in conjunction with ALL therapy. There have also been analysis of

      patients enrolled on trials who were diabetics on metformin and their outcome was better

      than patients on the same trial that were not on metformin as their antihyperglycemic.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study will be to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of

      arimoclomol in subjects with SOD1 positive familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

      This type of ALS is HEREDITARY (runs in families), and at least one other person in the

      family must have had ALS.



      Study hypotheses: Arimoclomol, taken at a dose of 200 mg three times daily will improve

      survival as defined by time to death, tracheostomy or permanent assisted ventilation. In

      addition, it will be safe and well tolerated in subjects with SOD1 positive familial ALS.

    <detailed_description>

      Using a seamless, adaptive, phase II/III design, the investigators will determine the safety

      and efficacy of arimoclomol in patients with SOD1 positive familial ALS. Both stage-1 and

      stage-2 are randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled in a population of patients with

      rapidly progressive SOD1 positive familial ALS. Patients with ALS, a history of a relative

      affected with ALS (i.e. familial ALS) and the presence of a demonstrable mutation in the

      SOD1 gene that is known to be associated with rapidly progressive disease, will be eligible

      for inclusion in this study. Potentially eligible subjects will undergo screening via

      telephone and, if necessary, review of outside medical records. The intervention will

      continue for up to 12 months. In the event that a participant reaches a study endpoint (e.g.

      tracheostomy or permanently assisted ventilation) study drug will be terminated. Subjects

      who meet all eligibility criteria will travel a study site for final eligibility

      determination, baseline evaluation and will then be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo

      or arimoclomol at a dose of 200 mg t.i.d. Participants will then be evaluated again in

      person at a study site at Month-2. Subsequent telephonic evaluations at Month-3, -4, -5, -6,

      -8, and -10 will be performed in participants' homes. Safety and tolerability evaluations

      will be performed at each of these visits. Collection of blood samples for safety laboratory

      analyses and measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and

      weight will be performed at Months -1, -3, -5, -6, -8, and -10 in the participant's home by

      a representative of a medical monitoring company. A study coordinator may perform an

      in-person visit at Month-12, or this visit may occur telephonically. A final evaluation will

      be performed via telephone at Month -13 (30 days after the last dose of study medication).

    <brief_summary>

      1. Delivery of directed hypofractionated targeted (HT) radiotherapy (RT) tumor boost to

           the dominant tumor lesion in the prostate as identified by multiparametric MRI will

           increase tumor eradication from the prostate.



        2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the multiparametric MRI defined regions at high

           risk of harboring tumors that determine outcome.



        3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have Circulating DNA or tumor cells (CTC) that are related

           to an adverse treatment outcome.



        4. Quality of life will not differ significantly between the treatment arms.



        5. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the HTIMRT arm, because the patients

           will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher radiation dose.

    <brief_summary>

      1. The investigators hypothesize that increasing radiation dose to the functional

           MRI-defined lesion in the prostate bed will result in an improved initial complete

           response (reduction in PSA to &lt; 0.1 ng/mL), which is related to long-term outcome

           biochemically.



        2. Biomarker expression levels differ in the DCE-MRI enhancing and non-enhancing tumor

           regions.



        3. 10-15% of men undergoing RT have free circulating DNA (fcDNA) or tumor cells (CTC) that

           are related to an adverse treatment outcome.



        4. Prostate cancer-related anxiety will be reduced in the MRI targeted SRT arm, because

           the patients will be aware that the dominant tumor will be targeted with higher

           radiation dose.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy

      and safety of ocrelizumab in comparison with Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in participants with

      relapsing multiple sclerosis. Participants will be randomized to receive either in Group A,

      ocrelizumab 600 milligram (mg) intravenously (IV) every 24 weeks plus Rabif placebo

      subcutaneously (SC) 3 times weekly, or, in Group B, Rebif 8.8 microgram (mcg) (Weeks 1 and

      2), 22 mcg (Weeks 3 and 4), and 44 mcg (Week 5 and thereafter) SC 3 times weekly plus

      ocrelizumab placebo IV every 24 weeks. Planned duration of double-blind treatment is 96

      weeks. Participants who complete the 96-week double-blind treatment will have an option to

      enter a single group, active treatment open label extension, providing they fulfill the

      eligibility criteria.

    <brief_summary>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety profile of BG00012

      (dimethyl fumarate). Secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term

      efficacy of BG00012 using clinical endpoints and disability progression, to evaluate further

      the long-term effects of BG00012 on multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions on magnetic

      resonance imaging (MRI) scans in participants who had MRI scans as part of Studies 109MS301

      (NCT00420212) and 109MS302 (NCT00451451) and to evaluate the long-term effects of BG00012 on

      health economics assessments and the visual function test.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The initial BG00012 dosage for the extension study (240 mg BID or 240 mg TID) was the same

      as that used in the Phase 3 Studies 109MS301 (NCT00420212) and 109MS302 (NCT00451451).

      Subsequent to the initiation of this study, BG00012 was approved in several countries for

      the treatment of MS at a dose of 240 mg BID. For this reason, all participants continuing in

      this study will receive the currently marketed dose of 240 mg BID.

    <brief_summary>

      This study is being done to determine if blood cell transplants, with either bone marrow or

      cord blood from unrelated donors, are effective in children with severe thalassemia and if

      this treatment approach has acceptable risks and side effects.



      This study includes a preparative regimen with Hydroxyurea, Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine,

      Thiotepa and Melphalan that provides intense host immunosuppression without myeloablation.

      The primary hypothesis is that this regimen will promote stable engraftment of unrelated

      donor hematopoietic cells, support normal erythropoiesis, and result in an event free

      survival of &gt; 75% of children with thalassemia major.

      This research trial studies a risk-based classification system for patients with newly

      diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Gathering health information about patients with

      acute lymphoblastic leukemia may help doctors learn more about the disease and plan the best

      treatment.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To provide a risk classification scheme for all patients with newly diagnosed acute

      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which will be used to assign treatment on Children's Oncology

      Group (COG) frontline ALL treatment studies.



      II. To capture classification data for correlative studies accompanying current COG ALL

      treatment protocols.



      III. To provide a central reference guide for all required and research studies that will be

      conducted in local and reference laboratories for all newly diagnosed ALL patients.



      IV. To provide a mechanism for optional banking of leukemia and germline specimens for

      current and future research.



      OUTLINE:



      Patients undergo blood sample collection and bone marrow biopsies at baseline and during and

      after induction therapy for immunophenotyping for ALL confirmation and classification,

      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy, genomic variation, and cytogenetic (BCR-ABL, trisomies

      4+10, and molecular testing for translocations) analysis by flow cytometry and fluorescent

      in situ hybridization (FISH). Immunophenotype results obtained on this study are used to

      determine patient's assignment to specific clinical-trial treatments. Some samples (leukemic

      and germline) may be banked for current and/or future analyses.

        Inclusion Criteria:



          -  Patient has newly diagnosed acute leukemia:



               -  &gt; 25% blasts on a bone marrow (BM) aspirate or



               -  If a BM aspirate is not obtained or is not diagnostic of acute leukemia, the

                  diagnosis can be established by a pathologic diagnosis of acute leukemia on a BM

                  biopsy or



               -  A complete blood count (CBC) documenting the presence of at least 1,000/uL

                  circulating leukemic blasts



          -  Adequate samples must be provided to the reference and/or COG-approved cytogenetics

             laboratories to allow completion of the studies needed for risk-stratification



               -  If a BM aspirate is not performed, or adequate material cannot be obtained,

                  peripheral blood (PB) can be substituted for BM if there are at least 1,000

                  circulating blasts/uL (i.e., a white blood cell [WBC] count of 10,000/uL with

                  10% blasts or a WBC count of 5,000/uL with 20% blasts); if only PB is submitted,

                  please obtain and send twice the volume of PB as the recommended BM volume

                  specified; the patient will remain on AALL08B1 as long as all required central

                  laboratory tests can be successfully performed; as long as there are at least

                  1,000/uL PB blasts, institutions are encouraged to submit PB in addition to BM

                  samples to make sure that adequate material is available to perform the required

                  studies



               -  If an adequate BM aspirate cannot be obtained and there are fewer than 1,000/uL

                  PB blasts, the patient is not eligible for AALL08B1 or a frontline COG ALL

                  clinical trial (there are NO exceptions to this rule)



          -  Patient has suspected ALL:



               -  Patients whose blast morphology is obviously myeloid, or whose blasts are

                  myeloperoxidase positive, should not be enrolled on AALL08B1; however, patients

                  with true biphenotypic or bilineage leukemia (i.e., patient presents with blasts

                  with significant expression of multiple lymphoid and myeloid markers such that

                  assignment to a single lineage is not possible) are eligible to enroll in

                  AALL08B1 for cell banking



          -  Samples must be sent to a COG-approved cytogenetics laboratory, and COG Reference

             Laboratory studies; if informative results needed for treatment stratification are

             not available at specified time-points during induction, patients will not be

             eligible to receive post-induction therapy on a COG ALL trial



          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed

             consent



          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Cancer Institute

             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met



        Exclusion Criteria:



          -  Patient must not have received prior cytotoxic therapy except for steroids or

             intrathecal chemotherapy



          -  Patient must not have secondary ALL that developed after treatment of a prior

             malignancy with cytotoxic chemotherapy

    <brief_summary>

      This partially randomized phase III trial studies different combinations of risk-adapted

      chemotherapy regimens and their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating

      younger patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia or

      B-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma that is found only in the tissue or organ where it began

      (localized). Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer

      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from

      spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy), giving the drugs in

      different doses, and giving the drugs in different combinations may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      l. To determine if a maintenance regimen containing weekly oral methotrexate at 40

      mg/m^2/week will result in an improved disease free survival (DFS) compared to that

      containing weekly oral methotrexate at 20 mg/m^2/week in the average-risk (AR) subset of

      patients with standard-risk B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).



      II. To determine whether a reduced-pulses maintenance regimen with vincristine (vincristine

      sulfate)/dexamethasone pulses delivered every 12 weeks can be used without adversely

      impacting DFS as compared to pulses given every 4 weeks in the AR subset of patients with

      standard risk B-precursor ALL.



      III. To confirm that patients in the low-risk (LR) subset of standard risk B-precursor ALL,

      based on clinical and cytogenetic features and minimal residual disease (MRD) criteria, can

      attain a 5 year DFS of at least 95% with either a P9904 based regimen that includes 6

      courses of intermediate dose (1 g/m^2 over 24 hours) methotrexate without alkylating agents

      or anthracyclines (Arm LR-M), or an outpatient based regimen identical to that of AR

      patients with reduced vincristine/dexamethasone pulses at 12 week intervals during

      maintenance (Arm LR-C).



      IV. To provide standardized treatment and enhanced supportive care to children with

      standard-risk (SR) Down syndrome-ALL in order to improve outcomes and facilitate further

      study of this biologically and clinically unique patient subgroup.



      V. To improve understanding of the biology of localized B-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma

      (B-LLy) and Down syndrome (DS) B-LLy by obtaining biologic data, including fluorescence in

      situ hybridization (FISH) for recurrent cytogenetic lesions on paraffin specimen, and

      banking tissue for future research.



      VI. To describe the 5-year EFS and overall survival (OS) of patients with Murphy stage I and

      II B-LLy receiving modified AR B-ALL therapy.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To assess the burden of AR B-ALL therapy as measured by surveys of the child's quality of

      life, missed days of school/daycare/work by children and parents, family functioning,

      parental perception of the child's health vulnerability, physical functioning, and emotional

      distress, 1) overall at different time points during and at the end of therapy, and by 2)

      comparing children randomized to every 4 week vs. every 12 week dexamethasone/vincristine

      pulses during maintenance. (Closed to accrual as of April 19, 2013) II. To characterize the

      onset, severity, and natural history of vincristine associated neuropathy by physical

      therapists (or occupational therapists) in children undergoing therapy for AR B-ALL, 1)

      overall at different time points during and at the end of therapy, and by 2) comparing

      children randomized to every 4 week vs. every 12 week dexamethasone/vincristine pulses

      during maintenance. (Closed to accrual as of March 15, 2013)



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To explore the correlation of minimal marrow disease (MMD) at diagnosis and outcome for

      patients with B-LLy.



      OUTLINE:



      All patients receive induction therapy comprising intrathecal (IT) cytarabine on day 1;

      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV twice daily

      (BID) on days 1-28; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on day 4; and IT methotrexate* on days 8

      and 29. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease are eligible to transfer to

      COG-AALL0622 by day 15 of induction therapy and patients with high-risk (HR) or very

      high-risk (VHR) disease are eligible to transfer to a COG HR or VHR trial at the end of

      induction therapy. Patients with standard-risk disease with Down syndrome (DS) who have bone

      marrow minimal residual disease 0.01% are eligible to transfer to the DS stratum of the HR

      trial. Patients with induction failure (defined as M3 [&gt; 25% lymphoblasts] on day 29) may be

      eligible for the COG VHR-acute lymphoblastic leukemia study.

      Objectives:



        -  To find out if the chance of developing a serious illness or of getting AIDS is less if

           patients start taking HIV medicines at a time when their cluster-of-differentiation-4

           (CD4)+ cell count is still fairly high, instead of waiting until the CD4+ count is at

           the level where there is good evidence for starting medicines.



        -  To learn more about how a strategy of starting HIV medicines early might affect other

           aspects of care, such as the chances of developing other illnesses or resistance to HIV

           medicines, the frequency of doctor visits, the cost of medical care, and general health

           and satisfaction.

      Background:



        -  Most guidelines agree that if the number of your CD4+ cells (cells in your blood which

           help fight infection) drops below 350 cells/mm3, or if you have symptoms of AIDS, you

           should start taking HIV medicines. There are randomized trials that support this

           recommendation. (Randomized trials are usually considered the strongest form of

           evidence to support treatment decisions. Other studies, like observational studies,

           provide evidence too, but the evidence is often considered to be weaker than evidence

           from randomized trials. A randomized trial gives the most certain information about how

           well a treatment works because randomization makes sure each group is similar except

           for the treatment they receive.) Some experts believe that HIV treatment should be

           started even when the number of CD4+ cells is above 350 cells/mm3. For example,

           guidelines issued in the US in December 2009 include a new recommendation for starting

           HIV medicines if your CD4+ cell count is between 350 and 500 cells/mm3. However, this

           recommendation is based on information from observational studies, not randomized

           trials. We are doing this study to find out if the chances of getting a serious illness

           or of getting AIDS are less if people start taking HIV medicines at a time when their

           CD4+ cell counts are still fairly high, instead of waiting to take HIV medicines at a

           CD4+ count where there is good evidence for starting medicines.



      Objectives:



        -  To find out if the chance of developing a serious illness or of getting AIDS is less if

           patients start taking HIV medicines at a time when their CD4+ cell count is still

           fairly high, instead of waiting until the CD4+ count is at the level where there is

           good evidence for starting medicines.



        -  To learn more about how a strategy of starting HIV medicines early might affect other

           aspects of care, such as the chances of developing other illnesses or resistance to HIV

           medicines, the frequency of doctor visits, the cost of medical care, and general health

           and satisfaction.



      Eligibility:



        -  Patients 18 years of age and older who are infected with HIV, have CD4+ cell counts of

           greater than 500 cells/mm3, and who have never had antiretroviral therapy to treat HIV.



      Design:



        -  Initial screening visits (2) to draw blood for CD4+ cell counts and provide a full

           medical history



        -  Patients will be randomly split into two groups:



      Early: Patients will begin receiving HIV medications from the start of the study.



      Deferred: Patients will begin to take HIV medications when the CD4 drops below 350

      cells/mm3, or they develop AIDS or other symptoms of HIV infection.



        -  HIV medications for each patient will be determined by the study doctors.



        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:



        -  Physical examination, including vital signs and body weight checks, and pregnancy test

           for women who can become pregnant.



        -  Questions about daily life, including sexual behaviors.



        -  Blood and urine tests.



        -  Heart tests with electrocardiogram.



        -  Patients will return for evaluations at 1 and 4 months after randomization, and every 4

           months thereafter for the duration of the study.



      Substudies will take advantage of the START randomization to compare outcomes in people

      starting ART early vs. later.



      The purpose of this randomized study is to determine whether immediate initiation of

      antiretroviral treatment (ART) is superior to deferral of ART until the CD4+ declines below

      350 cells/mm(3) in terms of morbidity and mortality in HIV-1 (subsequently referred to as

      HIV) infected persons who are antiretroviral naive with a CD4+ count above 500 cells/mm(3).



      The study will enroll an estimated 4,000 participants. Participants will be followed for at

      least 3 years after enrollment, to a common closing date.



      Substudies will take advantage of the START randomization to compare outcomes in people

      starting ART early vs. later. These will measure outcomes that do not require the entire

      sample size of START to determine whether early ART is related to a difference in these

      outcomes over the course of the study.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial is studying maintenance chemotherapy to see how well it

      works compared to observation following induction chemotherapy and radiation therapy in

      treating young patients with newly diagnosed ependymoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as

      vincristine sulfate, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin, work in

      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping

      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor

      cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation

      therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor

      cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may

      kill more tumor cells and allow doctors to save the part of the body where the cancer

      started.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine the event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of children with

      completely resected ependymoma treated with maintenance chemotherapy comprising vincristine

      sulfate, cisplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (VCEC) versus observation following

      post-operative conformal radiotherapy (cRT).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate the EFS and OS of children with incompletely resected ependymoma who are

      unable to achieve a complete response (CR) by post-operative induction chemotherapy or by

      second surgery who are non-randomly assigned to cRT followed by VCEC.



      II. To further evaluate the EFS and OS of children with supratentorial classic ependymoma

      who achieve a complete resection at first or second resection or children who achieve a CR

      to short-course induction chemotherapy following first surgery.



      III. To determine the neurologic, neuropsychological, and endocrine long-term sequelae of

      surgery, cRT, and VCEC as compared to those patients treated on COG-ACNS0121.



      IV. To determine biologic prognostic factors in childhood ependymoma by utilizing genomic

      profiles via comparative genomic hybridization and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays,

      and microarray gene expression profiling analysis on initial tumor samples and correlating

      this with clinical outcome.



      V. To evaluate prognostic immune-function gene expression in ependymomas. VI. To build upon

      the data derived from COG-ACNS0121 to develop genotypically based classification signatures

      and to correlate these to WHO grade, location, extent of resection, treatment, EFS, and OS.



      VII. To evaluate telomere maintenance as a prognostic marker.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to extent of

      resection at initial surgery (total vs near total resection), tumor histology, and tumor

      location (infratentorial primary tumor vs supratentorial anaplastic tumor). Patients are

      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with supratentorial classic tumor are assigned

      to arm II.



      All patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and

      8, carboplatin IV over 15-60 minutes on day 1, and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on

      days 1-2. Patients also receive etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3 of course 2

      only. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or

      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease, partial response, or locally

      progressive disease and who are deemed potentially resectable undergo surgery within 15 days

      after completion of induction chemotherapy.



      ARM I: Patients undergo conformal radiotherapy over 6-7 weeks. Patients then receive

      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, and 15 (courses 1-3 only); etoposide IV over 1-2 hours

      on days 1-3; cisplatin IV over 1-8 hours on day 1; and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60

      minutes on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM II: Patients undergo conformal radiotherapy over 6-7 weeks. Some patients undergo blood

      and tissue sample collection before treatment and after surgery for gene expression

      microarray, genomic hybridization array, and other correlative studies.



      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 4 months for 5 years.

    <brief_summary>

      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of vorinostat

      when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with metastatic or

      recurrent solid tumors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Vorinostat may stop

      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used

      in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the

      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving

      vorinostat together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in combination with paclitaxel and

      carboplatin in solid tumor patients with HIV infection.



      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination in this patient

      population.



      *NOTE: An administrative decision was made by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) to

      halt further study of vorinostat in this specific patient population as of February 1, 2013,

      and no patients remain on vorinostat. The primary objective going forward will determine the

      safety and tolerability of the paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in this patient

      population.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To preliminarily assess response rates of the therapeutic combination in lung, head and

      neck, and esophageal cancers.



      II. To evaluate the pathological characteristics of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome

      (AIDS) defining cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract.



      III. To determine the presence and oncogenic activity of human papillomavirus (HPV)

      infection in tumor tissues and to correlate HPV infection with clinical outcomes.



      IV. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between paclitaxel and

      antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by an expansion

      cohort study.



      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1-5 and paclitaxel intravenously

      (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21

      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      Some patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during course 1

      for pharmacokinetic studies and HIV viral load analysis.



      Note: An administrative decision was made by CTEP to halt further study of vorinostat in

      this specific patient population as of February 1, 2013. No patients remain on vorinostat.

      The primary objective going forward will determine the safety and tolerability of the

      paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in this patient population, without vorinostat. The

      information pertaining to vorinostat is for historical purposes.



      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3

      years.

    <eligibility>

        Inclusion Criteria:



          -  Patients must have known HIV infection and histologically confirmed solid malignancy

             that is metastatic or unresectable and is therefore incurable; although the focus of

             this trial will be on upper aerodigestive cancers (non-small cell lung cancer, head

             and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and non-gastroesophageal junction esophageal

             cancer), patients with other incurable solid tumor with disease potentially sensitive

             to carboplatin and/or taxanes (including but not limited to salivary gland cancer,

             gastric cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or anal cancer, BUT excluding Kaposi

             sarcoma), will be eligible



          -  Up to 1 prior systemic therapy regimen will be permitted for palliative treatment of

             metastatic or unresectable relapsed disease; however, previous chemotherapy delivered

             with curative-intent (i.e., chemoradiotherapy or adjuvant [postoperative]

             chemotherapy at a time disease was considered potentially curable) will be permitted;

             prior taxane (including paclitaxel or docetaxel) and/or platinum exposure will be

             permitted; however, patients must not experience disease progression within 3 months

             of platinum-based therapy; at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior

             chemotherapy or radiation therapy, 6 weeks if the last regimen included carmustine

             (BCNU) or mitomycin C; toxicities from prior anticancer therapy must have recovered

             to =&lt; Grade 1



          -  Serologic documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry, as

             evidenced by positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), positive Western

             Blot, or any other federally approved licensed HIV test; a positive HIV viral load

             prior to study entry will also be permitted



          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 50%)



          -  Documented life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks



          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL



          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL



          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL



          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits



          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase

             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;

             2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal



          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50

             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal



          -  Additionally, serum magnesium and potassium must be within institutional normal

             limits, and a CD4 count &gt; 100/mcL will be required within 2 weeks of study

             participation



          -  Presence of at least one measureable tumor lesion is required



          -  Participating patients must receive medically appropriate care and treatment for HIV

             infection, including antiretroviral medications, when clinically indicated, and

             should be under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management; with the

             exception of treatment with zidovudine and stavudine, patients will be eligible

             regardless of antiretroviral regimen (no antiretroviral therapy, nonnucleoside

             reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTI]-based therapy, or protease inhibitor based

             therapy), provided there is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been

             stable for at least 4 weeks with no intention to change the regimen within 8 weeks

             following study entry; the exact regimen used for HIV therapy will be captured on

             Case Report Forms; as study-specific (antiretroviral therapy-based) strata fill,

             however, only patients fitting the remaining open strata will be accrued



          -  Because histone deacetylase inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in

             this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must

             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;

             abstinence) prior to study entry, during the duration of study participation, and for

             at least 3 months following study completion; should a woman become pregnant or

             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her

             treating physician immediately; women of child-bearing potential must have a negative

             pregnancy test within 7 days before initiation of study drug dosing; post menopausal

             women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing

             potential; (Note: A woman of childbearing potential is one who is biologically

             capable of becoming pregnant; this includes women who are using contraceptives or

             whose sexual partners are either sterile or using contraceptives)



          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

             document; as the correlative studies are critical to the clinical and scientific

             value of the trial, CD4 count/HIV viral load determinations will be required, and

             participation in the tumor-based correlative studies will be strongly recommended;

             additionally, investigators MUST request sample donation to the AIDS Cancer Specimen

             Resource (ACSR); however, the patient may refuse sample donation; patients accrued to

             the expansion phase of the study will be required to undergo pharmacokinetic sampling



          -  Subjects must in the opinion of the Investigator be capable of complying with this

             protocol



        Exclusion Criteria:



          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for

             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not

             recovered from adverse events (toxicities not improved to =&lt; Grade 1) due to agents

             administered more than 4 weeks earlier; additionally, patients experiencing disease

             progression within 3 months of platinum-based therapy will be excluded from trial

             participation



          -  Due to availability of effective first- and second-line therapies (as well as

             disease-specific clinical trials), patients with diagnosis of active Kaposi sarcoma

             will be excluded from study participation; however, persons with other active

             malignancy with prior history of Kaposi sarcoma can be considered for participation

             at the discretion of the Study Chair



          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents



          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial

             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic

             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events



          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic

             composition to the study agents used in study (including hypersensitivity to

             paclitaxel, Cremophor, or platins)



          -  For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, inability to take oral medications;

             vorinostat capsules must be administered whole; note: this criterion does NOT apply

             to subjects treated on the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)



          -  As ketoconazole may inhibit paclitaxel metabolism, patients receiving ketoconazole

             for any treatment indication are ineligible; patients receiving any other medications

             or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 enzymes will be eligible;

             however, use all such medications or substances must be documented in the Case Report

             Forms



          -  For subjects assigned to take vorinostat, prior exposure to vorinostat or other known

             histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors for cancer therapy; patients should not have

             taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor, for at least 2 weeks

             prior to study enrollment; note: this criterion does NOT apply to subjects treated on

             the Expansion Cohort (accruals post February 1, 2013)



          -  Since zidovudine and stavudine have potential for severe hematological toxicity

             potentially overlapping with toxicities of the study therapy, treatment with these

             agents will be disallowed



          -  Due to potential toxicity associated with study therapy (particularly with

             paclitaxel), patients with peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 will be excluded from

             study participation



          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active

             infection, opportunistic infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that

             would limit compliance with study requirements; patients with HIV infection will be

             eligible provided they meet the criteria specified; patients with known Hepatitis B

             infection should be screened for active disease prior to study participation;

             patients with chronic Hepatitis C infection will be eligible at the discretion of the

             treating investigator



          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study and women who become pregnant while on

             study must be immediately discontinued; women who are breastfeeding will not be

             eligible for study participation

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to develop and field-test new tools for diagnosis and hazard

      assessment of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) in people with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and

      to advance the evidence base with much needed information on CMR and cardiovascular disease

      (CVD) burden in people with SCI. These data can be used to develop screening guidelines for

      early identification and prevention of CMR in SCI, as well as targeted approaches to primary

      disease management.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Unlike current assessments utilizing lipid scores, the new system will be anchored in more

      reliable measurements of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden using contemporary surrogate

      end points of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, coronary CT angiography and carotid

      intima media thickness (CIMT). By the end of the 5-year funding cycle we will develop an

      updatable web-based cardiometabolic risk assessment tool (RISK) that will allow clinicians

      and SCI consumers to quantify risk for a cardiovascular sentinel event (stroke, non-fatal

      heart attack, or death) and will also provide a body mass index (BMI) table adjusted for

      SCI.



      Specific Aims:



        1. Examine the relationships among surrogates of cardiovascular disease burden in persons

           with SCI and established cardiometabolic risks.



        2. Identify significant predictors of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) that are unique to

           persons with specific levels of SCI.



        3. Develop and validate SCI CMR assessment tool (RISK) based on cardiometabolic risk

           scores.



        4. Develop and validate an adjusted BMI table for SCI.

    <brief_summary>

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of

      subcutaneously (SC) administered multiple, escalating doses of BG00011 (a humanized

      monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha v beta 6 (αvβ6) integrin, formerly known as

      STX-100) in participants with IPF. The Secondary objectives are to estimate the

      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after the 1st dose and after the last dose of multiple,

      escalating doses of BG00011 in participants with IPF, to assess the immunogenicity of

      BG00011 in participants with IPF, and to assess the effect of BG00011 on biomarkers isolated

      from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood in participants with IPF.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:



          1. Clinical features consistent with IPF prior to screening (based on the American

             Society (JRS)/Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) consensus criteria for the

             diagnosis of IPF).

    <brief_summary>

      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed

      cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or

      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be

      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and

      able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and

      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that

      administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically

      with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests

      that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly,

      transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse

      ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in

      experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem

      cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9,

      several cell types derived from adult bone marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing

      within the heart itself16. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of

      whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both

      post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction

      and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have

      also been studied clinically.



      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for

      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone

      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this

      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority

      of the trials.



      Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive

      therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of

      eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less

      than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.

      This is a Pilot Study, intended as a safety assessment prior to a full comparator study. In

      this Pilot Study, cells administered via the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA injection

      catheter system will be tested in 36 patients in two groups:



      Group 1 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Auto-hMSCs: 20 million

      cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108

      (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.



      Group 2 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Allo-hMSCs: 20 million

      cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108

      (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.



      The first three (3) patients in each group (Group 1 and Group 2) will not be treated less

      than 5 days apart and will each undergo full evaluation for 5 days to demonstrate there is

      no evidence of a procedure induced myocardial infarction or myocardial perforation prior to

      proceeding with the treatment of further patients.



      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups.



      Treatment Strategies: Autologous hMSCs vs. Allogeneic hMSCs. The Study Team will record and

      maintain a detailed record of injection locations.



      If a patient is randomized to Groups 1 (Auto-hMSCs) and the Auto-hMSCs do not expand to the

      required dose of 1 X 108 cells, each injection will contain the maximum number of cells

      available.



      The injections will be administered transendocardially during cardiac catheterization using

      the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Catheter System.



      For patients randomized to Group 1(Auto-hMSCs); the cells will be derived from a sample of

      the patient's bone marrow (obtained by iliac crest aspiration) approximately 4-6 weeks prior

      to cardiac catheterization. For patients randomized to Group 2 (Allo- hMSCs), the cells will

      be supplied from an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source manufactured by the

      University of Miami. The Allo-hMSCs for patients in group 2 will be administered after all

      baseline assessments are completed with an expected range of 2 - 4 weeks post-randomization.



      Following cardiac catheterization and cell injections, patients will be hospitalized for a

      minimum of 2 days then followed at 2 weeks post-catheterization, and at month 2, 3, 6, and

      12 to complete all safety and efficacy assessments.

    <brief_summary>

      The use of adjuvant vaccination with autologous dendritic cells (DC) matured in situ after

      being loaded with tumor lysates derived from autologous refractory sarcoma tissue will be

      safe, feasible and potentially beneficial for patients diagnosed with sarcoma. This

      vaccination will result in evidence of immune stimulation against tumor antigens. In

      addition, combining myeloid derived supressor cells (MDSC) inhibition using gemcitabine with

      DC vaccination in this method will be safe and feasible and show improved immune parameters

      over DC vaccination without MDSC inhibition.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a dose finding / dose escalation study of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination

      administered through imiquimod (Aldara®) treated skin for refractory sarcoma patients, which

      includes a subsequent cohort of subjects who will receive DC and gemcitabine (Gemzar®)

      therapy. There are three intended dose levels for cell number of DC per treatment - 3, 6 and

      12 million cells per treatment. There will be 5 subjects accrued per dose level. If one

      subject in the first 5 patients per dose level experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT),

      then the dose level will be expanded to 8 subjects. If 2 or more of the subjects at a given

      dose level experience a DLT, then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be considered to

      have been exceeded. The MTD will be the cell dose level at which less than 1 in 5 or less

      than 2 in 8 subjects experience a DLT. Provision will be made to de-escalate to dose level

      0, or 1.5 million cells per treatment, should dose level 1 be too toxic. This is a 5+3

      design modified from the conventional 3+3 dose escalation schema used for testing cytotoxic

      agents in Phase I trials. A lower rate of DLTs is therefore potentially to be accepted on

      this study than on such a conventional dose escalation trial of a cytotoxic agent. If no MTD

      is reached, we will consider the third dose level to be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)

      going forward and expand this dose level to 8 subjects in total.



      After the MTD/RP2D is reached, we will commence with the addition of gemcitabine

      pre-treatment to the study therapy with the cell dose held at the dose determined for the DC

      alone. This will include weekly gemcitabine infusion for three weeks out of four before the

      initiation of vaccination. Gemcitabine treatment will commence as soon as the subject has

      safely recovered from pheresis, but within 2 weeks of completion of pheresis. DC vaccination

      will begin two weeks after the third administration of gemcitabine. Gemcitabine dosing will

      be constant, but should the combination of gemcitabine with the MTD/RP2D of DC alone prove

      too toxic, we will de-escalate the dose of DC on the gemcitabine containing levels. This

      de-escalation will mirror the dose escalation for DC alone, and the MTD for the DC plus

      gemcitabine will be defined as the dose level at which less than 1 in 5 or less than 2 in 8

      subjects experience a DLT.



      Subjects will undergo resection of tumor followed by pheresis to acquire monocytes which

      will be separated and used to grow out DC. Subjects not undergoing gemcitabine therapy will

      begin vaccination approximately two weeks after pheresis, depending on the manufacture time

      of their DC. All subjects will undergo lysate boost administration.

    <brief_summary>

      People with acute respiratory failure usually require the use of an artificial breathing

      machine, known as a mechanical ventilator. Sedative medications, which help keep people calm

      and reduce anxiety, are often prescribed for children who are on mechanical ventilators.

      However, the longer that sedative medications are used, the longer a child may need to

      remain on mechanical ventilation. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a team

      approach to sedation management that aims to reduce the number of days that children with

      acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      People who are hospitalized for acute respiratory failure are typically supported on

      mechanical ventilation, which delivers oxygen and a continuous level of pressure to the

      damaged lungs. Over 90% of infants and children supported on mechanical ventilation receive

      some form of sedation medication, which helps keep them safe, calm, and comfortable.

      Unfortunately, the use of sedation medications may prolong the duration of mechanical

      ventilation, which can lead to an increased risk for pneumonia and other complications.



      Recent studies among adults in intensive care units (ICUs) have shown that when doctors and

      nurses work together as a team to manage the use of sedation medication, patients are taken

      off mechanical ventilation sooner and with fewer side effects. This team strategy includes

      the following:



        -  Training and discussion between doctors and nurses regarding which sedative medications

           should be used



        -  Having doctors and nurses jointly identify the patient's progress and a daily sedation

           medication goal for the patient



        -  Having nurses use a decision-making tool to help guide changes in a patient's sedative

           medication dose



        -  Keeping track of patient care, which allows doctors and nurses to evaluate the

           effectiveness of how they manage each patient's sedative medication use



      This study will examine the use of the sedation management strategy for infants and children

      in pediatric ICUs who have acute respiratory failure and require mechanical ventilation. The

      purpose of the study is to evaluate whether this team approach to sedation medication

      management is more effective than the usual approach at reducing the amount of time children

      remain on mechanical ventilators. Study researchers will also examine the cost-effectiveness

      of this approach and associated quality of life factors.



      All participants will be enrolled within 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation and

      will be monitored until they receive their last dose of sedative medication, hospital

      discharge, or Day 28 (whichever comes first). During a 3-month baseline period, all

      participating pediatric ICUs will provide their usual sedation management, and study

      researchers will review participants' medical records on a daily basis. Each pediatric ICU

      will then be randomly assigned to either the control group or the team approach group.

      Pediatric ICUs in the control group will continue to provide usual care for sedation

      management. Pediatric ICUs in the team approach group will implement the team approach

      sedation management guidelines. For both groups, pain and sedation levels will be monitored

      daily, and study researchers will review participants' medical records on a daily basis,

      too. Six months after hospital discharge, half of the participants and their parents will

      complete a follow-up survey and take part in a telephone interview to assess quality of

      life, psychological factors, and health-related resource use.

    <brief_summary>

      The main purpose of this study is to find out how stimulant medications (methylphenidate or

      amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity

      Disorder (ADHD)are processed in HIV-1 infected and HIV-uninfected children and adolescents.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      P1080 is a pilot population pharmacokinetic study of HIV-1 infected and uninfected children

      and adolescents who are taking methylphenidate or amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine for the

      treatment of ADHD. Prescribing various psychiatric medications in combination with

      antiretroviral regimens is a standard clinical practice occurring without adequate evidence

      regarding benefits and risks. The goals of this study are to determine plasma concentrations

      of psychiatric and antiretroviral medications in children and adolescents. Psychiatric

      medication dose requirement and exposure in HIV-1 infected subjects will be compared to that

      seen in uninfected children and adolescents, and antiretroviral exposure will be compared to

      published studies in children and adolescents.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride or crizotinib with

      chemoradiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy

      that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and

      cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin,

      etoposide, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor

      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from

      spreading. It is not yet known whether giving erlotinib hydrochloride is more effective than

      crizotinib with chemoradiation therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To assess whether patients with unresectable local-regionally advanced non-small cell

      lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with targeted agents based on molecular characteristics have a

      longer progression-free survival than those treated with standard care therapy alone.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate response rate. II. To assess toxicity. III. To assess overall survival. IV.

      To correlate clinical outcomes with tumor molecular aberrations identified from deep

      sequencing of selected kinomes in patients from whom adequate baseline tissue is available.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.



      ARM I (induction therapy): Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily

      (QD) for up to 12 weeks. Patients who have had no response (partial or complete) after 6

      weeks undergo concurrent chemoradiation therapy immediately. After 2 weeks of completion of

      induction therapy, patients receive chemoradiation.



      ARM III (induction therapy): Patients receive crizotinib PO twice daily (BID) for up to 12

      weeks. Patients who have had no response (partial or complete) after 6 weeks undergo

      concurrent chemoradiation therapy immediately. After 2 weeks of completion of induction

      therapy, patients receive chemoradiation.



      ARMS II AND IV (concurrent chemoradiation): Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy with

      thoracic radiation therapy beginning on day 1. Treatment continues in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      CHEMORADIATION: In all treatment arms, patients undergo concurrent intensity modulated

      radiation therapy (IMRT) or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) QD 5 days a

      week for 6 weeks. Patients receive 1 of 2 chemotherapy regimens based on the discretion of

      the treating physician. Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days

      1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Treatment repeats every

      4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36

      during radiation therapy for 6 weeks. Two courses of consolidation treatment will begin 4-6

      weeks after completion of radiation therapy with paclitaxel IV on days 1 and 22 and

      carboplatin IV on days 1 and 22 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable

      toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months, 4-6 weeks,

      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

      The goal of ADDRESS is to quantify potential short- and long-term benefits of

      robotically-guided minimally invasive (MIS) or open spine surgery in adult spinal deformity

      patients, in comparison to image- or navigation-guided instrumentation in a matching cohort

      of control patients performed using a freehand technique, both in MIS and open approaches.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group

      study using avatrombopag to treat adults with thrombocytopenia associated with liver

      disease. The study will evaluate avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia

      associated with liver disease prior to an elective procedure to reduce the need for platelet

      transfusions or any rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural and post-procedural

      bleeding complications. Participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to mean

      baseline platelet count and, within each baseline platelet count cohort will be further

      stratified by risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate, or

      high) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) status (Yes or No).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This study will consist of 3 phases: Prerandomization, Randomization, and a Follow-up Phase.

      The Prerandomization Phase includes one Screening Visit that will take place from Day -14

      through Day -1; the Randomization Phase includes the Baseline Period, Treatment Period, and

      Procedure Day Period (5 to 8 days after last dose of study drug [Study Day 10 to 13]). The

      Follow-up Phase comprises 2 visits: 7 days post Procedure Day and 30 days after receiving

      the last dose of study drug. Permitted procedures include: Paracentesis; Thoracentesis;

      Gastrointestinal endoscopy with or without plans for biopsy, colonoscopy, polypectomy, or

      variceal banding; Liver biopsy; Bronchoscopy with or without plans for biopsy; Ethanol

      ablation therapy or chemoembolization for HCC; Vascular catheterization (including right

      side procedures in participants with pulmonary hypertension); Transjugular intrahepatic

      portosystemic shunt; Dental procedures; Renal biopsy; Biliary interventions; Nephrostomy

      tube placement; Radiofrequency ablation; and Laparoscopic interventions.

      This protocol is designed to validate use of the SPM for diagnosis of delayed gastric

      emptying in patients with symptoms of gastroparesis and assess impact of a SmartPill study

      on patient management in the gastroparetic populations. Patients with symptoms of

      gastroparesis will be recruited.



      Patients will undergo concurrent gastric scintigraphy and SPM testing to determine the

      presence or absence of delayed gastric emptying based on predetermined diagnostic cutoffs

      for each technique.

      The purpose of the study is to learn if monitoring dialysis access blood flow during

      dialysis treatment with a transonic machine (an ultrasound technique) will prevent (or

      reduce) the development of dialysis access thrombosis (clotting).



      Investigators would like to study if monitoring with a specific technique called ultrasound

      dilution technique can help prevent problems with access when compared to what is the

      current standard of care for patients.

      This study is intended to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial injection

      of allogeneic mesenchymal cells during the Bi-Directional Cavopulmonary Anastomosis (BDCPA)

      surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) pediatric patients.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is an open label study, intended as a safety and efficacy assessment prior to a full

      comparator study. In this Phase I study, cells administered will be delivered in 6

      intramyocardial injections that will be tested in 15 patients and 15 patients will be

      controls with a total of 30 HLHS patients.



      A total of 30 patients with HLHS will be enrolled in a staged enrollment process. In this

      open-labeled study, a maximum of 15 patients will eventually receive intramyocardial

      injection of the allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells and 15 control patients with no cell

      injection. The enrollment of the patients will occur in two stages groups: Group A and Group

      B. In Group A, 10 consecutive HLHS patients will be initially enrolled in the allogenic MSCs

      treatment arm to determine feasibility and safety. After 6 months of the last enrolled

      patient in Group A, all Group A patients will be assessed in order to determine whether it

      is feasible and safe, including the harvesting, processing, and administering of the

      allogeneic MSCs. Thereafter, Group B will start enrolling a total of 20 HLHS patients which

      will be randomized to the treatment and control arms in a 1:3 ratio, respectively, in order

      to have 5 allogeneic MSCs-treated patient and 15 control patients. At the completion of this

      Phase I clinical study, the total enrolled cohort will be 15 patients treated with

      allogeneic MSCs and 15 patients in the control arm.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the study drug relative

      to an active comparator losartan which the same class of drug and is approved for use in the

      pediatric population aged 6 years and older. Approximately 260 subjects will participate in

      a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, treatment phase, followed by a 2-week, double-blind,

      randomized placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. This study also includes a 44-week,

      open-label extension (OL Phase) in which all subjects will receive AZM and other

      antihypertensive medications (if needed) in order to reach an optimal blood pressure. Blood

      pressure will be assessed in the clinic throughout the study, and subjects may also

      participate in a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) procedure at baseline,

      at the end of the DB Phase and at the end of the OL Phase.

    <brief_summary>

      To establish a new treatment option for treatment-naïve participants with HIV-1, the

      efficacy and safety of doravirine will be determined relative to a protease inhibitor (PI).

      Participants will receive double-blind treatment during the 96-week Base Study. Eligible

      participants in either of the Base Study groups from sites in Argentina, Australia, Canada,

      Chile, the United States, or Puerto Rico will continue to receive the doravirine-containing

      regimen open label for an additional 96 weeks in the Extension Study. The primary hypothesis

      is that doravirine 100 mg once a day (q.d.) is non-inferior to darunavir/ritonavir (800

      mg/100 mg) q.d., each in combination with TRUVADA™ or EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™, as assessed by the

      proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 48. If

      non-inferiority is established, then the superiority of doravirine 100 mg q.d. compared to

      darunavir/ ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d. will be assessed.

    <brief_summary>

      Glaucoma is a progressive disease resulting in blindness. Determining the onset of the

      disease, predicting its severity and the benefit of pressure lowering eye drops is key to

      clinical management aimed at maintaining useful vision with advancing age. This study will

      longitudinally monitor a population of glaucoma suspects (with positive factors for the

      disease but with normal vision) with noninvasive pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and other

      standard eye tests for glaucoma. The PERG measures the function of retinal ganglion cells

      (RGCs) that are the parent neurons of the optic nerve. RGCs may become dysfunctional before

      dying and their function restored with pressure-lowering eye drops. Glaucoma suspects with

      abnormal PERG will be randomized to treatment with eye drops, while those with normal PERG

      will be left untreated. All patients will be monitored with PERG, Optic Coherence Tomography

      (OCT) and other ancillary tests every 6 months over 4 years.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The PERG is recorded from small metallic buttons taped on the skin similarly to an

      electrocardiogram, with the difference that the electrodes are around the eyes.



      The only physical contact you will experience is a gentle cleaning of the skin with an

      alcohol prep pad. During the test you must look with both eyes at a Television (TV) display

      for about 3 minutes. During the follow up period you may be asked to take one more PERG test

      lying down in a bed.



      This will cause a momentary increase of your eye pressure similar to the one that occurs

      during your normal sleep. This may help to understand whether or not your optic nerve

      functions normally when the pressure in your eye increases. For OCT evaluation, the pupil

      has to be dilated with drops as you did before for your eye exam. You have to briefly look

      at a mark inside the instrument one eye at a time.



      PERG and OCT will be performed during the same day of your visit with the eye doctor. If you

      have already done these tests in the past, as part of another study or as part of your

      standard treatment, the results of these tests will be obtained from your record, and be

      included in this study.



      If you are a participant in the Observation Group, you will be monitored with PERG, OCT, and

      standard clinical examinations every six months until close of study. If you are a

      participant in the Medication Group you will be also treated with eye drop medicines.



      RISKS:



      There are certain risks and discomforts that may be associated with this research. You

      should be aware that you are at risk of developing glaucoma whether you participate in the

      study or not. It is not known whether the risk of developing glaucoma is reduced by eye

      drops to lower eye pressure; the study will attempt to answer this question.



      For the PERG, the only significant risk to you is a small chance of a rash to the cleansing

      agent for skin electrodes, which should go away without treatment. For OCT, there is a rare

      risk to you of an allergic reaction to the drops used to dilate your pupils. The risk is

      even lower if you did not have any reaction during your previous eye exams. In case of an

      allergic reaction, your eye doctor will immediately treat it. If you had previous problems

      with pupil dilation, you may wish to speak to your eye doctor about the option of doing this

      additional test.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride, combination

      chemotherapy, and radiation therapy work and compares it to radiation therapy alone or in

      combination with pazopanib hydrochloride or combination chemotherapy in treating patients

      with newly diagnosed non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas that can be removed by

      surgery. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in

      chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to

      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,

      or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor

      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether

      radiation therapy works better when given with or without combination chemotherapy and/or

      pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To identify the dose of pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) that is feasible when given

      in combination with radiation or chemoradiation in pediatric and adult patients newly

      diagnosed with unresected intermediate- and high-risk non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue

      sarcomas (NRSTS).



      II. To compare the rates of near complete pathologic response (&gt; 90% necrosis) with the

      addition of pazopanib to preoperative chemoradiation versus preoperative chemoradiation

      alone for potentially resectable &gt; 5 cm, grade 3 intermediate to high risk

      chemotherapy-sensitive NRSTS in the phase II portion of the study for this cohort.



      III. To compare the rates of near complete pathologic response (&gt; 90% necrosis) with the

      addition of pazopanib to preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone

      for potentially resectable intermediate to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS in the phase

      II portion of the study for this cohort (using a phase II decision rule to go onto the phase

      III portion of the study).



      IV. To compare the rates of event-free survival (EFS) with the addition of pazopanib to

      preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone for localized intermediate

      to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS in the phase III portion of the study for this cohort

      if the phase II decision rule is passed.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate the rates of local failure, regional failure, distant metastasis free

      survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival with the addition of pazopanib to

      preoperative chemoradiation or preoperative radiation in intermediate to high risk adult and

      pediatric NRSTS.



      II. To compare the pattern of recurrence (local, regional and distant) between preoperative

      chemoradiation or radiation with the addition of pazopanib for adult and pediatric NRSTS.



      III. To define the toxicities of ifosfamide and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride)

      chemotherapy and radiation when used in combination with pazopanib in intermediate to high

      risk adult and pediatric NRSTS.



      IV. To define the toxicities of preoperative radiotherapy when used in combination with

      pazopanib in intermediate to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To gain insight into the disease biology of childhood and adult NRSTS through analysis of

      actionable mutations and whole genome sequencing.



      II. To determine if microvessel density and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)

      predict response to pazopanib and outcome.



      III. To determine the effect of pazopanib on doxorubicin exposure in children and adults

      with NRSTS.



      IV. To evaluate change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)

      maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) from baseline to week 10 or 13 in patients with

      unresected tumors and to correlate this change with pathologic response and EFS.



      V. To compare the rate of response by standard imaging and pathologic assessment to

      determine which correlates better with local tumor control, distant tumor control, EFS, and

      overall survival.



      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pazopanib hydrochloride.



      CHEMOTHERAPY COHORT: Patients eligible for chemotherapy cohort are randomized to 1 of 2

      treatment regimens.



      REGIMEN A:



      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on

      weeks 1-12, ifosfamide intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 1, 4, 7, 10,

      and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 1 and 4. Patients

      undergo radiation therapy on weeks 4-10.



      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery on week 13.



      CONTINUATION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on weeks 16-25,

      ifosfamide IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 16 and 19, and doxorubicin hydrochloride

      IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 16, 19, and 22. Patients undergo radiation therapy

      on weeks 16-25 for a total of 45 Gy.



      REGIMEN B:

      10 and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 1 and 4. Patients

      undergo radiation therapy on weeks 4-10.



      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery on week 13.



      CONTINUATION PHASE: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-3 on weeks 16

      and 19 and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1-2 on weeks 16, 19, and

      22. Patients undergo radiation therapy on weeks 16-25 for a total of 45 Gy.



      NON-CHEMOTHERAPY COHORT: Patients eligible for non-chemotherapy cohort are randomized to 1

      of 2 treatment regimens.



      REGIMEN C:



      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on weeks 1-9. Patients

      undergo radiation therapy on weeks 1-7.



      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery on week 10.



      CONTINUATION PHASE: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on weeks 13-25. Patients

      Olaparib treatment in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and high risk HER2 negative

      primary breast cancer who have completed definitive local treatment and neoadjuvant or

      adjuvant chemotherapy

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Patients will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to either olaparib or placebo. Randomisation will

      be stratified by Hormone receptor status (ER and/or PgR positive/HER2 negative versus TNBC),

      prior neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy and prior platinum use for breast cancer.



      Randomised patients will receive study treatment for up to a maximum of 12 months. All

      patients will have safety assessments every 2 weeks during the first month, every 4 weeks

      for the following 5 months and 3 monthly for the remaining 6 months of study treatment plus

      30 days after its discontinuation. Following randomisation, all patients will be assessed

      regularly for signs, symptoms and evidence of disease recurrence by taking medical history,

      physical examination and mammogram/breast MRI. Efficacy assessments will be performed on a 3

      monthly basis during the first 2 years, followed by 6 monthly assessments for years 3, 4 and

      5 and annually thereafter. All patients (except those with bilateral mastectomy) will have

      mammogram / breast MRI annually for 10 years beginning 6 months after randomisation.



      All randomised patients will have clinical assessment visits for 10 years following their

      randomisation into the study. Once a patient completes 10 years of clinical assessment they

      will enter the survival follow up phase of the trial which will continue until 10 years

      after the last patient is randomised.

      long-term effects of eteplirsen up to 96 weeks.



      Sites are currently being initiated into the study. Initiation of approximately 39 planned

      sites in the United States is expected to be completed by June 2016. The initiated sites can

      be found in the "Contacts and Locations" section of this posting in addition to a listing of

      the city and states of sites the investigators are working to initiate. This information

      will be updated on a rolling basis as additional sites are initiated.

    <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label, multi-center, 48-week study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of

      eteplirsen in patients with genotypically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with

      genetic deletions amenable to exon 51 skipping (treated group), with a concurrent control

      arm of DMD patients not amenable to exon 51 skipping (untreated group). Following primary

      efficacy endpoints at week 48, dosing will continue to week 96 to evaluate the long term

      effects of eteplirsen.



      Patients in the treated group will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30

      mg/kg Eteplirsen. Patients in the untreated group will not receive treatment.



      Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional

      tests such as the six minute walk test. Patients in the treated group will undergo a muscle

      biopsy at Baseline and a second muscle biopsy over the course of the study. Patients in the

      untreated group will not undergo muscle biopsy.



      Safety, including adverse event monitoring and routine laboratory assessments, will be

      continuously monitored for all patients.



      The sponsor is working to initiate approximately 39 sites across the United States. Sites

      will vary in the following functions:



        1. Local Site (N=39) - Enrolls patients and is the primary contact point for their

           patients. Sites will perform all protocol activities (including dosing and laboratory

           assessments), except for functional assessments and biopsies.



        2. Hub Site (N=14) - Performs functional (physical) assessments at specified times per

           protocol.



        3. Surgical Site (N=2) - Performs muscle biopsies for the Treated group.

    <brief_summary>

      THAOS is a global, multi-center, longitudinal observational survey open to all patients with

      transthyretin-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), including ATTR-PN (polyneuropathy), ATTR-CM

      (cardiomyopathy) and wild-type ATTR-CM. It is open-ended with a minimum duration of 10

      years. Patients will be followed as long as they are able to participate.



      The principal aims of this outcome survey are to better understand and characterize the

      natural history of the disease by studying a large and heterogenous patient population.

      Survey data may be used to develop new treatment guidelines and recommendations, and to

      inform and educate clinicians about the management of this disease.

    <detailed_description>

      Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults and is thought to

      be particularly resistant to systemic treatment, and no systemic therapy has yet been

      demonstrated to improve survival. Drugs commonly used to treat advanced cutaneous melanoma

      rarely achieve durable responses in patients with uveal melanoma. Because of the lack of

      effective systemic treatment options, outcomes are poor once metastatic disease occurs, and

      the median survival from the time of the development of distant metastatic disease is 6 to

      12 months. Although it is clear that novel effective therapies are desperately needed for

      this disease, the development of such therapies has been hampered by the rarity of uveal

      melanoma.

             that could interfere with the absorption of AEB071 or BYL719 (e.g. ulcerative

             disease, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small

             bowel resection).



          -  Patients who have received prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, such as cyclical

             chemotherapy or biological therapy within a period of time that is shorter than the

             cycle length used for that treatment (e.g. 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin-C)

    <brief_summary>

      The long‐term goal is to acquire scientific knowledge that can be used to develop

      mechanistic-driven intervention strategies aiming at restoring upper and lower-limb motor

      function in individuals with cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). The proposed

      project will examine cortical, corticospinal, and spinal contribution to bilateral hand and

      arm muscle activity during bilateral movements and spinal contributions to lower limb muscle

      activity. By comparing changes in different sites within the Central Nervous System (CNS),

      the investigators may also identify key mechanisms that might be differentially affected by

      the injury, plasticity, and training.

    <detailed_description>

      If the participant qualifies to take part in this research study, they will be asked to

      participate in 15-190 study visits,to complete the experimental procedures. These procedures

      have been broken up into "Phases" and will be completed in any order. Phase I and Phase IIa

      includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each to measure arm and finger strength

      and ability to move. Phase IIb includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each, to

      measure leg strength and ability to move. Phase IIIa includes up to 40 total visits -

      approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again evaluate the participant's ability

      to use both arms. The participant will be asked to complete a series of tasks such as

      stacking checkers, turning over cards, squeeze a device to determine how strong their grip

      is, and see how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of their skin. The

      investigators will complete these assessments at pre-determined times during the study

      participation. Phase IIIb includes up to 40 total visits - approximately 2 hours each, the

      investigator will again evaluate the participant's ability to use both legs. Assessments of

      the participant's legs will include walking around the lab space, how well they can bend

      their ankles and hips, and how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of the

      participant's skin.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether treatment with isradipine is effective in

      slowing the progression of Parkinson disease disability.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The study will enroll 336 participants in this multi-center study at approximately 56 sites

      across the US and Canada. In this study, we are comparing 10 mg of Isradipine to Placebo for

      treatment of newly diagnosed PD patients. Isradipine has been approved by the Food and Drug

      Administration (FDA) to treat high blood pressure but is considered investigational in this

      study, as it has not been approved for use in patients with PD.Isradipine can affect the

      function of specialized channels that are present in the types of brain cells that are

      affected in PD patient. These cells are usually responsible for making dopamine, which is

      depleted in patients with PD. Isradipine may block the damage caused by the flow of certain

      chemicals through these channels. Laboratory data has showed that Isradipine may prevent the

      development of Parkinson-like symptoms in animal studies. Isradipine has been evaluated in

      some patients with PD. The first study with isradipine controlled release (CR) in patients

      with early PD and normal blood pressure found that the drug was reasonably well tolerated

      and safe. The controlled release formulation of isradipine is not available for use and

      therefore this study is using the immediate release formulation. Eligible participants will

      be followed for up to 36 months and will be expected to complete 12 in-person visits and 4

      telephone visits. The study visits will include clinical assessment of motor,

      neuropsychiatric and cognitive testing as well as collection of blood and urine samples.

      Study drug will taken twice daily, in the morning and in the evening with or without food.

      Prior to taking study drug, study participants will be required to take their blood pressure

      with a home blood pressure device provided to them for use in this study.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of Part 1 of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of

      dalantercept in combination with axitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma

      (RCC) to determine the recommended dose level of dalantercept in combination with axitinib

      for Part 2.



      The purpose of Part 2 of this study is to determine whether treatment with dalantercept in

      combination with axitinib prolongs progression free survival (PFS) compared to axitinib

      alone in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Phase 1b: To evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a recommended phase 2 dose for

      TRC105 when added to standard dose axitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.



      Phase 2: To estimate the PFS of patients with advanced or metastatic RCC by RECIST 1.1

      criteria in patients treated with axitinib and TRC105 compared to those treated with

      axitinib alone, following failure of one prior VEGF TKI

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Axitinib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular

      endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma

      concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and

      cancer progression. Axitinib is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma,

      following progression on one prior systemic therapy. TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an

      important angiogenic target on vascular endothelial cells that is distinct from VEGFR.

      TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models and

      complements the activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase inhibitors that target VEGFR. In a

      phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors,TRC105 therapy caused a global reduction in

      angiogenic biomarkers and reduced tumor burden at doses that were well-tolerated. By

      targeting a non-VEGF pathway that is upregulated following VEGF inhibition, TRC105 has the

      potential to complement VEGF inhibitors and could represent a major advance in cancer

      therapy. TRC105 potentiates bevacizumab and VEGFR tyrosine kinases (VEGFR TKI) in

      preclinical models. In a phase 1b study, the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab produced

      radiographic reductions in tumor volume in bevacizumab refractory patients. Together, the

      use of TRC105 with axitinib may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and

      improved clinical efficacy over that seen with axitinib alone.

             hysterectomy) or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception

             during the study and for 3 months following last dose of TRC105. All female patients

             of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within

             7 days prior to first dose. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to

             use effective contraception during the study and for 3 months following last dose of

             TRC105. The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of

         19. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may

             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the

             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for this study

    <brief_summary>

      The rationale of this study is to further fine-tune and individualize prophylactic treatment

      of patients with severe Haemophilia A with the goal of keeping the trough FVIII level above

      1% between doses. Because trough FVIII levels are likely to be important predictors of the

      efficacy of prophylaxis, the focus of this study is on PK data.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, the Optune device has on

      the patient and meningioma. This study is being done because currently there are no proven

      effective medical treatments for a progressive meningioma that has failed surgery and/or

      radiation. The study uses an experimental device called Optune. Optune is "experimental"

      because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this

      type of tumor, although it has been approved for a different type of brain tumor.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution, based on

      the total amount of supplemental opioid analgesic used over 12 hours or 24 hours after

      initiation of investigational medicinal product in children and adolescents who have

      undergone surgery that would produce moderate to severe pain during opioid treatment.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), multi-site, double-blind

      (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),

      placebo-controlled (placebo is compared with the study medication to test whether the study

      medication has a real effect in clinical study), parallel group (each group of participants

      will be treated at the same time), and multiple oral dose study.



      This study will consist of an enrollment phase (up to 28 days), a treatment and evaluation

      phase (4 days), and a follow-up phase (10 to 14 days after the first dose of IMP). A dose

      regimen of 1.25 mg/kg will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment in this study in

      children aged 6 months to less than 18 years old. After 24 hours after the start of study

      medication, and based on clinical judgment, the dose may either be continued at 1.25 mg/kg

      or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on

      the effectiveness of the analgesia (pain killer) and the adverse event profile observed in

      each child over the first 24 hour dosing period. The doses for participants aged less than 6

      months old will be defined based on the forthcoming pharmacokinetic (what the body does to a

      medication) data. The supplemental opioid medication reflecting the standard of care will be

      available as patient or nurse controlled intravenous morphine or hydromorphone. This

      supplemental opioid medication will be given to control pain, as needed, in both the

      treatment and placebo groups.



      In exceptional cases, if a participant has unbearable pain despite using NCA/PCA, an

      additional bolus (defined as a clinician bolus) of morphine or hydromorphone may be

      administered. The clinician bolus can be given either using the NCA/PCA pump system or by an

      intravenous bolus injection. The opioid given as a clinician bolus or if the NCA/PCA

      intravenous line fails must be the same as that used in the NCA/PCA pump system.



      Dosing with Investigational Medicinal Product will be stopped if:



        -  A switch to exclusively oral opioid analgesic medication is indicated according to the

           local standard of care.



        -  Opioid analgesic medication is no longer needed.



        -  Investigational Medicinal Product has been administered for 72 hours.



      Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory

      parameters, electrocardiogram, and specific scale to assess suicidal ideation. The maximum

      study duration for each participant will be 42 days.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies how well crizotinib works and compares it to placebo

      in treating patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has been removed by

      surgery and has a mutation in a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Mutations,

      or changes, in ALK can make it very active and important for tumor cell growth and

      progression. Crizotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the ALK protein from

      working. Crizotinib may be an effective treatment for patients with non-small cell lung

      cancer and an ALK fusion mutation.

    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy with crizotinib will result in improved overall

      survival (OS) over placebo for patients with stage IB &gt;= 4 cm, II and IIIA, ALK-positive

      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate and compare disease-free survival (DFS) associated with crizotinib and

      placebo.



      II. To evaluate the safety profile of crizotinib when given in the adjuvant therapy setting.



      III. To collect tumor tissue and blood specimens for future research.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM A: Patients receive crizotinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment

      repeats every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or

      unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up

      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.

    <brief_summary>

      Total cystectomy (surgical removal of the bladder) is performed in a number of settings,

      including invasive bladder cancer and radiation cystitis. This requires a urinary diversion

      to be performed. The most common type of urinary diversion in this setting is an ileal

      conduit, where a section of small intestine is fashioned into a conduit that drains urine

      through a stoma into a pouch appliance, which is adhered at the level of the abdominal wall

      skin.



      There are multiple risk factors associated with the development of parastomal hernia after

      ileal conduit formation, including obesity, stoma site and size of the abdominal wall stoma

      opening.



      Up to 30% of patients with parastomal hernia will undergo surgical correction, mainly due to

      discomfort, urine leakage, skin excoriation, difficulty in maintaining a watertight ostomy

      appliance, increased frequency of ostomy pouch changes, or rarely due to bowel

      strangulation. Parastomal hernia repair is a challenging procedure which is not without

      significant risks. Furthermore, the outcomes of parastomal hernia repair surgery are highly

      variable.



      Prevention of parastomal hernia resulting from ileal conduit formation will help to decrease

      the incidence of hernia related complications, including pain, bowel complications, and

      urinary leakage due to poor stoma appliance. It will also decrease the significant cost

      associated with frequent stoma pouch changes. Prevention of parastomal hernia is expected to

      improve the quality of life of patients undergoing ileal conduit, and will reduce the need

      for secondary operations.

    <brief_summary>

      Connect.Parkinson is a randomized comparative effectiveness study, comparing usual care

      enhanced with educational materials to usual care, educational materials, and the delivery

      of specialty care via telemedicine into patient's homes. The study's specific aims are the

      following:



        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of using telemedicine to deliver specialty care into the

           homes of individuals with Parkinson disease who have limited access to care;



        2. To show that such an approach can improve quality of life;



        3. To establish that the telemedicine can enhance the quality of care; and



        4. To demonstrate that this remote approach to care saves time, reduces travel, and

           decreases care partner burden.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Connect.Parkinson is a national study examining the feasibility and effectiveness of using

      video calls to bring expert Parkinson disease care directly into patients' homes. Currently,

      access to care for Parkinson disease is limited by distance, disability, and the

      distribution of doctors. Approximately 200 individuals with Parkinson disease (who due to

      distance, disability, disparity, or doctor distribution have limited access to care) will be

      randomized to one of two arms in this comparative effectiveness study. The first (control)

      arm will be the individual's "usual care" supplemented by educational materials on their

      condition. This usual care may include care from a generalist, care from a neurologist, or

      in-person care from a Parkinson specialist. The care received by the control group will vary

      but will be an accurate reflection of usual care in this country. The second (intervention)

      arm will be usual care supplemented by educational materials and care from a Parkinson

      disease specialist delivered via web-based video conferencing into the patient's home. The

      participants will also be asked with they have a primary care partner, and care partners

      will be invited to enroll, for a total of approximately 400 participants.

    <brief_summary>

      It is estimated that 2 out of 3 patients with a stroke have some problems with their memory,

      difficulties performing certain tasks, making decisions and learning new things. In

      addition, many stroke patients do not get regular exercise and are often sedentary. Both

      physical and cognitive exercise have the potential to improve quality of life, cognition,

      and overall health, but the safety and tolerability of such interventions is not clear in

      stroke patients. The investigators will examine these outcomes by allocating stroke survivor

      participants to one of three groups: an exercise program, a combined exercise and cognitive

      training program and a sham control group.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Stroke is well recognized as the leading cause of disability in the United States. Cognitive

      deficits after stroke are common, even in those without dementia prior to the event, and

      stroke patients with worse cognition on hospital admission have worse outcomes. Cognitive

      deficits contribute to stroke-related disability and mortality. Evidence suggests an

      interaction between cognitive deficits and physical limitations, and cognitive

      rehabilitation may improve functional outcomes post stroke. Recent data also suggest that

      both cognitive training and exercise interventions improve cognition in stroke patients, but

      few randomized trials of these interventions, alone or in combination, have been conducted.



      We will study the effects of a Combined Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Training (CARET)

      program, and the combination of the CARET and CTI interventions on the primary outcome of

      safety, feasibility, and adherence among ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke survivors with mild

      to moderate disability. We hypothesize that these interventions are safe and tolerable, and

      that they will lead to improvements in our secondary outcomes of cognitive performance and

      quality of life. We will also explore the role of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor in

      cognitive changes related to the physical exercise intervention.

      The influence of Decipher test on urologist and patient treatment plan choices immediately

      post RP and at the time of PSA rise or BCR

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This prospectively decision impact study will evaluate physicians and patient treatment plan

      choices before and after reviewing Decipher results for eligible patient cases. The clinical

      utility of Decipher will be evaluated for patients meeting the inclusion criteria at two

      time-points post-RP:



        1. In the adjuvant setting: within 12 months after surgery (in the absence of detectable

           PSA rise of BCR)



        2. In the salvage setting: post-RP with evidence of PSA rise or BCR (defined as PSA

           detectable and rising on 2 or more subsequent determinations)



      A total of 150 patient cases, in each arm, will be prospectively selected from clinical

      sites. The study as a whole will enroll 300 patient cases.



      As a condition of participation in the study, each clinical site must agree to provide a

      minimum of 10 patient cases.

    <official_title>PDE5 Inhibition Via Tadalafil (Cialis®) to Enhance Anti-Tumor MUC1 Vaccine Efficacy in Patients With Resectable, and Recurrent or Second Primary Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC): A Phase I/II Clinical Trial</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      The investigators hypothesize that Tadalafil treatment, by lowering Myeloid Derived

      Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), can prime an antitumor immune

      response and promote a permissive environment that should increase the efficacy of

      anti-tumor vaccine in a setting of minimal residual disease.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The investigators will perform a phase I/II placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients

      with HNSCC whose tumor has recurred, or secondary primary tumor is detected, post

      conventional radiotherapy with or without prior surgery or chemotherapy. For these patients,

      salvage surgery is the only standard curative therapeutic option, post-surgical recurrence

      rate is high, and life expectancy is poor. Patients will be given Tadalafil (or Placebo) in

      combination with vaccination (anti-MUC1 + anti-Influenza vaccines or placebos) prior to

      surgery, and in 3 additional courses after surgery in combination with

      anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccines (or placebo vaccines). A final booster vaccination (with

      anti-MUC1/anti-Influenza vaccines or placebo vaccines alone) will be administered

      approximately one-year post salvage surgery. Response to treatment will include

      antigen-specific immune response and characterization of the leukocytes subset. As a

      secondary endpoint, tumor recurrence at 2 years will be evaluated to determine whether a

      trend toward a beneficial prognosis might be observed in treated patients.



      Eligible patients who are unwilling to receive study treatment but who undergo standard

      curative resection and consent to be followed for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and/or to

      donate specimens for correlative research studies (blood and/or tumor) will also be included

      in all analyses as an additional non-randomized control group. These analyses may include

      all blood tests obtained as for non-control patients at specified study intervals and DTH

      testing as for non-control patients at specified intervals. Control group patients may elect

      to not undergo blood tests and or DTH testing at any specified time interval at their

      discretion but will continue to be followed for recurrence free survival.

      This study is designed to evaluate the use of a collection of tests that measure the eye

      response, balance, oculomotor and reaction time tests to aid in the diagnosis of mTBI. The

      tests use highly precise measurement tools to assess various neurologic functions. (For

      example, high-speed cameras to record eye movement, high-end motors to precisely spin and

      move the subject, comprehensive analysis to stitch together the stimulus and the response.)

        1. A battery of oculomotor, vestibular and reaction time tests will generate variables

           that when properly weighted and run through a given multi-variant analysis, will

           separate the subjects into one of two groups, mTBI or not-mTBI.



        2. A battery of neurologic assessment tests including reaction time, vestibular and

           oculomotor tests taxing a range of neurologic functions and executed using one or more

           of the I-Portal® family of devices, will generate responses that, when used by a

           trained physician, can aid in the diagnosis of an mTBI.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The study uses a prospective, between-subjects design comparing an Investigational (mTBI)

      Group to a Control Group. The Investigational Group includes SM who had been diagnosed with

      an mTBI. The Control Group consists of SM who do not have clinical symptoms consistent with

      mTBI. There will be 90 participants in each group, for a target total of 180 study

      participants



      Existing mTBI evaluation tools will be used to qualify the type and severity of a patient's

      mTBI symptoms. After the volunteer has been assessed by a physician, the following

      questionnaires and screening tools will be administered:



        -  Demographic, included control and patient demographics, education, military service,

           see Appendix A;



        -  History of health problems and treatments included medication and mTBI history and

           stress level before testing, including page 1 of MACE, see Appendix B; History of

           health problems and treatments included medication and mTBI history and stress level

           before testing, including page 1 of MACE, used for seconds and third tests only, see

           Appendix B1;



        -  Glasgow Coma Scale, use only in 24 hrs after accident, see Appendix C;



        -  Functional Gait Assessment(FGA) - This is an assessment where the individual is asked

           to perform ten gait tasks. Each gait task is scored by a trained observer on a 0-3

           scale (with 0 being could not perform and 3 being performed well). The individual will

           end up with a total FGA of between 0-30. The test is very sensitive for demonstrating

           balance dysfunction and improvement.(see Appendix D)



        -  Trail Making Test (TMT) - This test is a cognitive test in which subjects use a pencil

           to draw a line between an ordered series of letters or letters/numbers on a paper.

           Subjects are instructed to follow the appropriate order without lifting the pencil from

           the paper. Time to completion is a sensitive measure of cognitive performance. (see

           Appendix E)



        -  Dizziness Handicap Inventory,(DHI)-This validated questionnaire is commonly used by

           clinicians to qualify and quantify symptoms associated with dizziness,

           light-headedness, vertigo, migraine associated dizziness, and to assist with

           identifying complaints of dizziness related to anxiety, depression,

           post-traumatic-stress disorder, etc. This tool will capture subjective symptoms

           associated with mTBI prior to completing the objective measures (see Appendix F)



      Device will be comprehensive oculomotor/ neuro-otologic testing system. System components:



        -  Motorized Chair that can move in up to 3 axis



        -  Full field Optokinetic stimulus



        -  Pursuit Tracker™ - laser target generator



        -  Isolation enclosure



        -  Patient monitoring and communication technology



      FDA classification: The NOTC is covered under an FDA 510K, and certified to standards

      60601-1, 60601-1-1, 60601-1-2, and 60601-1-4.



      Modifications to approved device:



      Included by manufacturer:



        1. A new function to existing buttons for reaction time test



        2. Audio stimulus for audio reaction time test



        3. 2 stationary LED's installed inside enclosure ceiling for crHIT test



      Investigational software which incorporates newly defined oculomotor and reaction time tests

      designed to investigate mTBI will be installed on the device.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of autologous human Schwann cell (ahSC)

      transplantation in participants with chronic SCI.



      This trial design is phase I, open label, unblinded, non-randomized, and non-placebo

      controlled multiple injury cohorts.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      For humans with chronic SCI, we hypothesize that axons might show improved function if

      myelin repair is induced with the implantation of ahSC. In addition spinal cord cavitation

      may be reduced, and neural sprouting and plasticity may be enhanced via neurotrophic

      effects. In this trial, subjects will receive fitness conditioning and rehabilitation prior

      to transplantation in order to validate the stability of their neurological baseline and

      enhance their ability to undergo surgery with few complications. They will also receive

      fitness conditioning and rehabilitation post-transplantation to maintain health and promote

      neuronal activity and potential neuroplasticity.



      Trial enrollment will target 2 cohorts. The first cohort will be thoracic (T) level 2-12

      ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A, B, or C (n = up to 4), the second cohort will be

      cervical (C) level 5 through T1 AIS A, B, or C (n = up to 6). Two (2) participants with AIS

      grade A will be enrolled prior to enrolling a participant with AIS B or C, applicable to

      both cohorts.



      Participants will be monitored throughout a 6 month post-transplantation evaluation period

      for occurrence of AEs (acute, delayed, and/or cumulative), as well as for changes in

      clinical status and neurological status. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed

      at weeks 1 and 2 post-transplantation and months 2 and 6 post-transplantation.

    <brief_summary>

      The Investigators propose an investigation of the safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for

      the alleviation of chronic neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).



      Aim 1 is to determine whether DBS in the periaqueductal/periventricular gray region

      (PAG/PVG) of the brain at analgesic intensities produces any systemic or neurological

      adverse effects in patients with longstanding SCI (&gt;1 year), either immediately or as a

      result of prolonged application for up 40 weeks.



      Aim 2 is to determine whether acute application of DBS in the PAG/PVG influences the

      severity of spontaneous ongoing pain caused by longstanding SCI.



      Aim 3 is to determine whether DBS in the PAG/PVG affects stimulus-evoked or persistent

      hypertension (a major sign of autonomic dysreflexia) in chronic SCI patients.



      Aim 4 is to determine whether prolonged PAG/PVG stimulation (for 40 weeks) leads to

      cumulative changes in chronic pain severity or in the motor or autonomic symptoms of chronic

      SCI patients.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The current study attempts to utilize deep brain stimulation of the periaqueductal grey

      (PAG) for diminution of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain in spinal cord injury

      patients. Likewise, the study will look at the effects on autonomic function as well. Deep

      brain stimulation, as a treatment, has gained widespread use for the treatment of various

      movement disorders. It is currently approved for use by the FDA for treatment of Parkinsons

      Disease, Essential Tremor, and Dystonia. Over 100,000 implants have been performed worldwide

      for these indications. The safety profile is well defined.



      Pain is a tremendous burden for those who suffer with SCI. Persistent pain below or at the

      injury level is experienced in 2/3rd of chronic SCI patients. As a result of this pain at

      least 1/3rd of this sub-population faces a severely reduced quality of life; some

      authorities consider this rate to be much higher, based on surveyed pain ratings. It was

      reported that 23% of a sample patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI and 37% with low

      thoracic or lumbosacral SCI would sacrifice sexual, bowel and bladder function for good pain

      relief.



      SCI pain is typically a mixture of nociceptive pain, which is caused by activation of

      primary afferents' receptors, and neuropathic pain, which is caused by damage to the nervous

      system. Neuropathic pain of SCI is most frequently treated by anticonvulsant agents. There

      is good evidence from randomized control trials for some degree of effectiveness of

      gabapentin and pregabalin, with weaker evidence for valproic acid. Tricyclic antidepressants

      are also used to control SCI pain, but the supporting evidence is not as strong. Thus

      amitriptyline has proved somewhat effective when the patient is depressed, but trazodone was

      reported not to reduce post-SCI neuropathic pain more than placebo. Traditional analgesics

      are also useful. Morphine can provide effective relief of neuropathic pain due to SCI, and

      can be combined with the alpha-2 agonist clonidine for this purpose. Subarachnoid or

      epidural lidocaine has been used to obtain short-term relief. For the musculoskeletal pain

      in SCI, which nociceptive, antispasticity agents are frequently used; intrathecal baclofen,

      for example, can be fairly effective. Despite this considerable range of choices,

      pharmacological treatment for the pain of SCI remains inadequate. Low effectiveness,

      tolerance, side effects or difficulties with prolonged local administration (e.g., subdural)

      are among problems encountered.



      Due to the combination of severity of chronic pain SCI patients are faced with and the

      inadequate medical treatments available that this study is pertinent. Although, prior

      attempts at clinical studies to show efficacy of DBS for pain have essentially failed, the

      Investigators believe this current protocol offers some unique aspects. Likewise, as

      mentioned earlier, both neuropathic and nociceptive pain related to SCI is devastating for

      those afflicted. The Investigators have performed a detailed literature search and reviewed

      all papers related to DBS and pain. To date there has been very few studies looking at DBS

      for pain. Of those papers, the etiology of pain was very variable with only a small subset

      related to spinal cord injury. Of the papers, including spinal cord injury none were well

      controlled and even fewer reported detailed outcomes, other than to say there was no pain

      control. Also of importance was that none of those studies truly looked at the effects of

      chronic stimulation on pain control. This is to say, that each paper had as a criteria, that

      the patient felt immediate relief of pain at the time of surgery or else the leads were

      removed and no further stimulation was given. Most papers to date do not detail the outcome

      measures used to determine pain relief. There are various pain scales that can be used to

      determine level of pain control, some more accurate than others. Our study will also look at

      the effects of alternating stimulation parameters on a monthly basis from therapeutic

      stimulation parameters to sub-therapeutic parameters in a double blinded fashion (patient

      and examiner). This method of evaluation will give us a unique way to evaluate pain control

      yet to be performed in any of these prior studies. Likewise, the Investigators will also

      evaluate the subject's ability to decrease both antiepileptic drugs as well as narcotics as

      DBS progresses.



      For the reasons above, the Investigators feel our study is different from those of the past.

      The Investigators believe that due to the severity of the problem and lack of effective

      therapeutic options combined with the less than stringent studies to date that our study

      should be done. The Investigators realize that prior attempts at pain control with DBS have

      been lackluster. However, our study is not only based on prior clinical attempts but also on

      basic science research from the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. These studies performed by

      Dr. Ian Hentall (co-investigator) suggest strongly that stimulation of the periaqueductal

      grey on a chronic basis is effective for pain control. Likewise, they suggest a beneficial

      effect on autonomic dysreflexia, a potentially life threatening complication of SCI, as

      well. As a result, our study will also focus on evaluating the effects of DBS on autonomic

      dysreflexia with very stringent outcome measures, another unique aspect of this study. There

      is also data in humans to suggest that the PAG is a central control center for autonomic

      function.



      Key Points:



      Primary Rationale



        1. Need. Many patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (SCI)

           experience long-term suffering and have no recourse to adequate alternative therapy.

           Analgesic drugs are at best of weak or inconsistent efficacy for a given patient and

           can produce serious side effects at typical doses. This clinical trial is therefore

           qualitatively different from trials comparing some improved drug (etc.) with a

           currently used one.



        2. Prospects. Pain of many types is responsive acutely to stimulation in the

           periaqueductal/periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG; our anatomical target). There is a

           large confirmatory literature on this in both animals and man, going back 3-4 decades.

           A review analyzing PAG/PVG stimulation in prior clinical studies for all types of

           drug-refractory pain uncovered 148 cases with a 79.1% success rate after lead

           internalization.



        3. Clinical evidence. With regard to acute relief of chronic SCI pain by DBS in PAG/PVG,

           the Investigators believe that useful evidence is non-existent at present, but that the

           benefits of PAG/PVG stimulation for other kinds of pain strongly justify a targeted

           evaluation. In the above-cited 2005 meta-analysis, pain originating from spinal cord

           injury was identified in 10 cases and leads were internalized in 7 of these cases, of

           which 5 showed good long-term pain relief. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell from

           the cases described in the original articles, many from the 1970s, whether the sensory

           thalamus (a different brain region, probably less appropriate) or the PAG/PVG or both

           were stimulated. Moreover, the clinical literature on DBS for SCI pain rarely describes

           the type of injury (segmental level, completeness, age or onset, etc.) and often

           includes non-typical SCI in its summary categories (e.g., root avulsion, myelopathy).

           Because of the conflation of stimulation sites and the poor characterizations of the

           injuries, these factors need to be revisited in a more thorough analysis.



        4. Preclinical evidence. Prolonged DBS improves other symptoms of SCI as well as pain. The

           Investigators have found that various types of sensory and motor performance and

           anatomical damage are restored. Recovery of autonomic dysreflexia, and improvements in

           gastric emptying, insulin level and glucose control have been measured more recently.

           These improvements remain when the stimulation ceases. Separately from pain, it is

           important to find out in man whether the Investigators can safely replicate these

           findings, with possible great benefit to patients. Thus there is a potential for (a)

           immediate pain relief, (b) long-term changes in pain status (such that the stimulation

           can be reduced or stopped), (c) general improvement in different visceral or motor

           symptoms of the SCI syndrome.



        5. Surgical issues. In the past, typically, at some point during the surgery, tests were

           done on whether the patient's pain is reduced immediately upon stimulation. If not,

           then leads were never internalized. The Investigators believe that this protocol may

           have reduced success rates needlessly. Acute effects of electrode insertion may have

           been present that prevented immediate benefits of the stimulation. Also, the most

           benefits the Investigators postulate are due to long-term effects of the stimulation.

           So the efficacy of DBS for pain, including SCI pain, may have been greatly

           underestimated. The present study will include patients that do not show an acute

           benefit immediately after surgical electrode implantation.



        6. Safety. DBS has a very low rate of complications, which are mostly correctable.



      Other Authorities



        1. The Granting Agency (DOD), Regulatory Agency (FDA) and Device Manufacturer (waiver from

           Medtronic Corp) have all supported the validity of this study.



        2. The procedure (DBS in PAG/PVG for pain) is currently being used in the United Kingdom,

           Germany, Australia and other countries.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to examine impact of Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) treatment

      in persons with chronic Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The central hypothesis is that the

      treatment of SDB with Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) will improve cognition, sleep quality,

      health related quality of life (HRQOL), pain and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) surrogate

      measures in persons with chronic SCI.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Investigators will examine the effect of PAP therapy and sleep apnea on thinking (especially

      memory, learning and concentration), quality of life, sleep quality, and risks for future

      heart (cardiovascular) problems in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).



      SDB is a condition where there are pauses in breathing or shallow breathing during sleep due

      to airway narrowing. This leads to low oxygen levels during sleep and sleep disruption. The

      usual treatment for sleep apnea is PAP (Positive Airway Pressure) worn while sleeping. This

      involves the use of usually a mask connected to a machine that supplies enough pressure to

      keep the airway open during sleep.



      SDB will be diagnosed in SCI participants using unattended portable level II polysomnography

      (PSG) (a portable at home sleep study for one night).



      Sleep quality (SQ), SDB risk, insomnia severity, daytime sleepiness, pain severity, mood,

      and HRQOL will be measured using questionnaires.



      Cognitive evaluations will be completed prior to randomization on all participants who also

      complete a portable PSG to evaluate general and pre-morbid function, immediate verbal

      memory, simple and sustained attention, processing speed, and executive function.



      Blood and urine samples will be taken for participants with SDB diagnosis after

      randomization.



      All randomized subjects will be fitted with a nasal or full-face mask and head gear. PAP

      will be delivered by an auto-titrating device. These devices automatically set the level of

      delivered pressure to ensure upper airway patency, to treat detected apneas, and hypopneas.

      All subjects will be instructed to use the device nightly during sleep, for the ensuing four

      months. All outcome measurements will be reassessed after four months of PAP.

    <brief_summary>

      Patients with sickle cell disease many have a number of systemic complications, including

      liver problems. Some of these liver problems lead to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, secondary to

      chronic blood transfusions. The purpose of this study is to investigate FibroScan readings

      in patients with sickle cell disease and iron overload secondary to blood transfusions, and

      to correlate the FibroScan results with Ferriscan. A comparison with the results of

      FibroScan to patients with Sickle cell without known liver disease, who have never been on

      chronic transfusions and with normal liver function profiles will also be made.The primary

      hypothesis is that the results of FibroScan will correlate with the results of Ferriscan and

      liver biopsy.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Liver biopsy is the gold standard to examine the liver for iron deposits and histology.

      However, liver biopsy is invasive and involves a risk of bleeding and pain. Biopsy may also

      miss significant pathology if the small biopsy specimen is taken from an uninvolved part of

      the liver. Non-invasive techniques such as MRI are now used to evaluate the liver iron

      content. MRI can visualize the whole liver and measure liver iron content. MRI, however,

      will not detect liver scarring.



      Liver transient elastography (FibroScan) is a non-invasive ultrasound tool for assessing

      liver fibrosis or scarring by measuring liver stiffness (LSM). Compared with liver biopsy,

      FibroScan provides immediate results and is a painless, short (3 mins), simple procedure to

      perform. In some studies FibroScan reports have correlated well with liver biopsy results of

      fibrosis and cirrhosis, and with Ferriscan, ferritin and liver function tests.



      This purpose of this study is to investigate the role of FibroScan in individuals with

      sickle cell anemia and iron overload or who have a diagnosis of liver disease, and to

      compare FibroScan readings with magnetic resonance imaging.



      We will also compare the results of the Fibroscan with liver biopsy.



      This study will also compare the results of FibroScan to patients with Sickle cell without

      any known liver disease, who have never been on chronic transfusions (defined as no more

      than 4 transfusions in lifetime) and who have normal liver function profiles.

    <brief_summary>

      Drugs used as chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide work in different

      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from

      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy

      with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial studies how well

      chemotherapy and radiation therapy work in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed

      central nervous system germ cell tumors.

    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine, as measured by the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and patterns

      of failure, whether dose and volume of irradiation can be safely reduced to 30.6 Gy whole

      ventricular-field irradiation (WVI) plus 23.4 Gy primary site boost instead of 36 Gy

      craniospinal irradiation (CSI) plus primary site boost in the subgroup of children and young

      adults with localized nongerminomatous germ cell tumor (NGGCT) who have a magnetic resonance

      imaging (MRI) and tumor marker criteria (CSF and serum) for confirmed complete response (CR)

      or partial response (PR) to induction chemotherapy and negative serum and cerebrospinal

      fluid (CSF) tumor markers OR in patients who have less than a PR after induction

      chemotherapy with negative tumor markers who undergo a second-look surgery and are found to

      have only mature teratoma, residual scar or fibrosis, and fit the definition of CR/PR after

      second-look surgery.



      II. To determine, as measured by the 3-year PFS rate and patterns of failure, whether

      simplified chemotherapy followed by dose-reduced radiation therapy is effective for treating

      children and young adults with localized primary central nervous system (CNS) germinoma who

      present with serum and/or CSF human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCGβ) =&lt; 50 mIU/mL.



      III. To prospectively evaluate and longitudinally model the cognitive, social, and

      behavioral functioning of children and young adults who are treated with reduced radiation

      dose and volume of irradiation in Stratum 1 (NGGCT) and with dose-reduced radiation therapy

      in Stratum 2 (Germinoma) using the ALTE07C1 protocol (This objective will be assessed

      independently for the two strata).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      To estimate the PFS and overall survival (OS) distributions of patients with NGGCT treated

      with 30.6 Gy WVI and involved-field radiation therapy (IFR) focal boost to 54 Gy. II. To

      estimate the PFS and OS distributions of localized-germinoma patients who present with serum

      and/or CSF hCGβ ≤ 50 mIU/mL vs serum and/or CSF hCGβ &gt; 50 mIU/mL and =&lt; 100 mIU/mL.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to localized primary

      disease (nongerminomatous germ cell tumor [NGGCT] vs germinoma).



      Stratum 1 (NGGCT): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 15-60

      minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 of courses 1, 3, and 5.

      Patients also receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 of

      courses 2, 4, and 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responsive disease (complete [CR] or

      partial response [PR]) to induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy once daily (QD) 5 days

      a week for 6 weeks. Patients with PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) and

      normalization of tumor levels undergo second-look surgery. Patients who achieve CR or PR

      after second-look surgery undergo radiotherapy.



      Stratum 2 (Germinoma): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over

      15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every

      21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with CR or continued CR undergo radiotherapy QD 5 days a week for approximately 4

      weeks. Patients with PR, SD, or PD with normal tumor markers may undergo second-look

      surgery. Patients found to have mature teratoma or non-viable tumor during surgery undergo

      radiotherapy. Patients with PR or SD with residual disease (=&lt; 1.5 cm) and suprasellar (&gt;

      0.5 cm) or pineal (&gt; 1 cm) involvement and normal tumor markers undergo radiotherapy after

      chemotherapy without second-look surgery.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,

      every 4 months for 2 years, and then annually for up to 3 years.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, evaluator and subject blinded, parallel-group, controlled

      study intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating obese patients with the

      placement of g-Cath EZ suture anchors followed by a structured diet and exercise plan as

      compared to a sham procedure followed by the same diet and exercise plan. Subjects will be

      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the treatment procedure followed by diet and exercise or

      the sham procedure followed by diet and exercise. After un-blinding at 12 months

      post-treatment, sham patients can choose to have the treatment procedure as well.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics ASG-22CE as well as

      assess the immunogenicity and antitumor activity in subjects with metastatic urothelial

      cancer and other malignant solid tumors.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      All subjects will receive a single 30 minute IV infusion of ASG-22CE once weekly for 3 weeks

      of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 4 weeks. The study design will

      follow a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM).



      Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of ASG-22CE,

      investigator decision or consent withdrawal. Subjects will have a Safety Follow up Visit a

      minimum of 28 days after the last ASG-22CE infusion.



      A data review team (DRT) will review cumulative unaudited data on an interim basis to

      explore additional doses and/or schedules, or the expansion of existing cohorts. Doses

      intermediate to those predefined in the protocol may be explored with DRT endorsement.

    <brief_summary>

      The BLaStM clinical trial extends the Phase I LEAD trial and compares the LEAD upfront

      technique for increasing dose to the MP-MRI defined GTVs to the HEIGHT method of using a

      moderate hypofractionated simultaneous integrated boost to the MP-MRI defined GTVs through

      the course of radiotherapy. The hypothesis is that alternate mechanisms of cell death,

      including bystander effects, are put in place when doses above 8 Gy per fraction are used in

      a lattice and that the effects on local tumor eradication will be greater using this

      strategy.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Radiotherapy (RT) is a commonly applied primary (initial definitive) treatment alternative

      to prostatectomy that allows for preservation of anatomy and the potential for improved

      functional outcome with better tumor targeting and normal tissue sparing. About 30-50% of

      men ultimately develop biochemical failure (BF) after RT. Persistence of disease in the

      dominant lesion is indicated to be a common mechanism responsible for progression. Prostate

      cancer has a long natural history. BF typically precedes clinical progression to metastasis

      by many years and local persistence has been implicated. While survival at 10 years is high

      overall, quality of life is affected by failure of any kind. Pathologic complete response

      (PathCR) by standard ultrasound guided systematic prostate biopsies at 2-3 years after RT is

      the strongest post-treatment (post-Tx) predictor of patient outcome yet identified.

      Multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) parameters identify dominant tumor areas in the prostate with a

      fairly high sensitivity and specificity, and MP-MRI directed biopsies should, therefore,

      further strengthen the association between prostate biopsy results and patient outcome.



      The proposed research compares two previously explored methods (LEAD and HEIGHT) for

      escalating dose to MP-MRI defined prostate regions directly and addresses the goals of 1)

      improving local control via targeted radiotherapy (RT) dose escalation to the MP-MRI defined

      high risk (dominant) tumor areas using PathCR based on MP-MRI-directed biopsies at 2-2.5yr

      after treatment as the primary endpoint; 2) preserving quality of life by minimizing dose to

      the nearby organs at risk around the prostate; and 3) establishing the relationship of pre-

      and serial post-Tx MP-MRI parameters to PathCR.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment

      on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of alisertib in adult participants with cancer.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to assess

      how it is processed by the body in participants with advanced solid tumors or

      relapsed/refractory lymphoma with varying degrees of liver function. This study will also

      assess laboratory results and safety.



      The study will enroll approximately 48 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of

      the 3 treatment groups based on the status of their liver function: Normal hepatic function

      (Total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of the normal range [ULN] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]

      level ≤ ULN), moderate hepatic impairment (Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5-3 x ULN and ALT level =

      Any), or severe hepatic impairment (Total bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN and ALT level = Any). All

      participants will be administered one 50 mg dose of alisertib on Day 1, Cycle 1. Alisertib

      will be administered again on Days 8 through 14 of Cycle 1, followed by a 14-day rest

      period. Doses administered on Days 8-14 will be 50, 30, or 20 mg of alisertib, depending on

      hepatic function. Alisertib may then be continued at the same dose as in Cycle 1, Days 8-14

      in 21-day cycles (7 days of alisertib followed by a 14-day rest period) for up to 1 year

      (approximately 16 cycles).



      This multicenter trial will be conducted in USA only. The overall time to participate in

      this study is up to 13 months unless it is determined by the investigator, with agreement by

      the sponsor, that a participant would derive clinical benefit from continued treatment

      beyond 12 months. Participants will make up to 51 visits to the clinic including an

      end-of-study visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,

      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced solid tumors, including glioma,

      that harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase

      where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum

      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study

      is a dose expansion phase where four arms of patients will receive AG-120 to further

      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose.

      Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity

      occurs or at Investigator discretion.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a safety and tolerability trial to evaluate the effect of subretinal injection of

      human embryonic stem cell derived retinal pigment epithelium cells in patients with

      Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy (SMD).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This study is a Phase I/II, open-label, non randomized, sequential, multi-center clinical

      trial. There will be 5 cohorts, the 4 low vision cohorts will contain 3 patients, the better

      vision cohort will contain 4 patients. The enrolled cohorts will be as follows:



      Three SMD patients- 50,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted



      Three SMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted



      Four Better Vison SMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted



      Three SMD patients- 150,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted



      Three SMD patients- 200,000 MA09-hRPE cells transplanted



      Patients will be enrolled sequentially, and within each cohort of 3 patients, each patient's

      clinical course over the first 6 weeks following cell transplantation will be reviewed by an

      independent (DSMB) before enrollment is opened for the next 2 patients. A full safety

      assessment of all 3 patients in each cohort will be made by the DSMB when the 3rd patient in

      each cohort completes 4 weeks of follow-up, and before the first patient in the next cohort

      receives a cell transplant. The exception is the better vision group where all patients may

      be enrolled once DSMB approval has been received.



      Each cohort will be enrolled sequentially in turn, with the exception of the better vision

      cohort which may be enrolled in parallel with the other cohorts.



      The day of the cell implantation will be Day 0, and patients will remain in the study until

      the last visit at 12 months.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Deep Brain stimulation (DBS) on

      walking in patients with Parkinson's disease that have had DBS. While DBS improves

      Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms and walking in many patients in some of the patients

      walking problems persist. This study aims to find out what are the best stimulation

      parameters of the DBS in order to improve walking.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Parkinson disease (PD) is defined by the presence of a resting tremor, slowness, stiffness

      and problems with balance and walking. Gait disorder in Parkinson's disease is common and

      has a greater impact on quality of life. Currently, carbidopa-levodopa and Deep Brain

      Stimulation are the only treatments available for gait impairment.



      This study is meant to see if there is improvement in gait or freezing of gait are seen

      after changes in the stimulation parameters. Subjects will be randomly assigned to four

      different stimulation parameters: both stimulators on (BL ON), both stimulators off (BL

      OFF), right stimulator on (R ON), left stimulator on (L ON). The investigators will assess

      your gait using a clinical scales as well as wearable sensors attached to your body.

      Assessments will be done one hour after each change in the stimulation parameters.



      Gait will be studied using wireless sensors attached to the ankles and wrists to determine

      speed, stride length and turning time.

    <brief_summary>

      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab

      vedotin when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in

      treating patients with stage II-IV human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin

      lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may block cancer growth in

      different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin

      hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the

      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by

      stopping them from spreading. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination

      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of brentuximab vedotin

      when combined with the doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (AVD)

      chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma. (Phase

      I) II. Establish an estimate of the two-year progression-free survival for participants with

      HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma when treated using brentuximab vedotin plus the

      AVD chemotherapy regimen. (Phase II)



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate the toxicity of AVD and brentuximab vedotin with highly active antiretroviral

      therapy (HAART).



      II. To estimate the partial response (PR) rate, complete response (CR) rate, overall

      survival (OS), and event free survival (EFS) at 2 and 5 years.



      III. To evaluate the effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on cluster of differentiation

      (CD)4 and CD8 counts after cycle 1, 4, at the end of therapy, and every 3 months after

      treatment completion for one year.



      IV. To investigate the prognostic value of fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission

      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline, after cycle 2, and at treatment

      completion, with respect to 2-year progression free survival.



      V. To evaluate HAART status at baseline and to correlate this with tumor response to therapy

      and OS and progression-free survival (PFS).



      VI. To characterize the histologic subtypes in HIV-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the highly

      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era.



      VII. To assess the neurotoxicity of HAART in combination with AVD and brentuximab vedotin.



      VIII. To evaluate effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on viral load after cycles 1, 4, at

      the completion of therapy, and every 3 months after treatment completion for one year.



      IX. To perform pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies to determine drug levels during

      therapy.



      X. To perform micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) profile analysis on the HIV-HL tumor specimens

      and to correlate miRNA expression with OS, PFS, tumor response to therapy, histologic

      subtype of HIV-HL, and HIV disease characteristics.



      XI. To perform tissue microarray analysis on HIV-HL tumor specimens and to correlate the

      markers studied with OS, PFS, and tumor response to therapy.



      XII. To identify Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor derived deoxyribonucleic acid

      (DNA) in the plasma of study participants and to correlate these levels during therapy with

      disease response and OS. (Phase II) XIII. To identify cytokines in the plasma of

      participants during therapy that can be used as tumor and prognostic markers. (Phase II)

      XIV. To assess latent and expressed HIV reservoirs before, during, and post chemotherapy. To

      understand how cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents affect HIV expression.



      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase

      II study.



      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), vinblastine sulfate IV, and

      dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30

      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence

      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and

      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level of LY3039478 that can safely

      be taken by participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of

      the body, including but not limited to lymphoma. The study will also explore changes to

      various markers in blood cells and tissue. Finally, the study will help to document any

      tumor activity this drug may have.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      In Part A of this study, participants with advanced/metastatic cancer (including lymphoma)

      will receive increasing doses of LY3039478 to define the dose level for Part B, C, and D. In

      Part B, C, and D LY3039478 will be explored at a predefined fixed dose level. Participants

      in Part B and D must have a defined alteration in a certain molecular pathway. Enrollment of

      participants in Part B, C, and D will start once Part A is completed.

    <brief_summary>

      Hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT)are one treatment option for people with leukemia or

      lymphoma. Family members,unrelated donors or banked umbilical cordblood units with similar

      tissue type can be used for HCT. This study will compare the effectiveness of two new types

      of bone marrow transplants in people with leukemia or lymphoma: one that uses bone marrow

      donated from family members with only partially matched bone marrow; and, one that uses two

      partially matched cord blood units.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) has allowed older

      and less clinically fit patients to receive potentially curative treatment with allogeneic

      HCT for high risk or advanced hematological malignancies. Patients lacking an HLA-matched

      sibling may receive a graft from a suitably HLA-matched unrelated donor. However, up to a

      third of patients will not have an HLA-matched sibling or a suitably matched adult unrelated

      donor (i.e., no more than a mismatch at a single locus). Even when a suitably matched

      unrelated donor is identified, data from the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) indicate

      that a median of four months is required to complete searches that result in

      transplantation; thus, some number of patients succumb to their disease while awaiting

      identification and evaluation of a suitably matched adult unrelated donor.



      Single or dual center studies have shown that partially HLA-mismatched related bone marrow

      (haplo-BM) and unrelated double umbilical cord blood (dUCB) are valuable sources of donor

      cells for RIC HCT, thus extending this treatment modality to patients who lack other donors.

      In order to study the reproducibility, and thus, the wider applicability of these two

      alternative donor strategies, The Blood and Marrow Transplantation Clinical Trials Network

      (BMT CTN) conducted two parallel multicenter prospective Phase II clinical trials. These two

      studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of related haplo-BM (BMT CTN 0603) and dUCB (BMT

      CTN 0604) transplantation after RIC. Both of these alternative donor approaches produced

      early results similar to that reported with unrelated donor, and even HLA-matched sibling,

      HCT. These data demonstrate not only the efficacy of both of these approaches, but also that

      both can be safely exported from the single center setting. Both haplo-BM and dUCB grafts

      can be obtained rapidly for greater than 90% of patients lacking an HLA-matched donor. This

      study will test the hypothesis that progression free survival at two years after RIC

      haplo-BM transplantation is similar to the progression free survival after RIC dUCB

      transplantation.

      The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,

      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-120 in advanced hematologic malignancies that

      harbor an IDH1 mutation. The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where

      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-120 to determine maximum

      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study

      is a dose expansion phase where four cohorts of patients will receive AG-120 to further

      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose.

      Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

      occurs.

      This is a point prevalence study conducted entirely in the United States (US) to establish

      the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis E virus (HEV) and other selected porcine viruses

      in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients receiving pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) for

      pancreatic insufficiency compared with matched (age and region of residence) control

      patients with chronic medical conditions unexposed to PERT.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter, non-interventional point-prevalence study conducted in the US to

      determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to selected porcine viruses in pancreatic enzyme

      replacement therapy-exposed CF patients and in an unexposed control group with chronic

      medical conditions matched for age and geographic region of residence. Data collection

      includes demographic and medical history, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, transfusion

      history, and history of potential exposure to pig viruses. If a patient meets all the

      requirements of the study and provides a study specific informed consent/assent, a single

      blood sample is obtained as part of a planned standard-of-care blood collection.



      This harmonized protocol reflects equal sponsorship not only by the registering Sponsor,

      AbbVie, but also the Collaborators, Aptalis Pharma and Janssen Research &amp; Development, LLC.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies armodafinil to see how well it works in reducing

      cancer-related fatigue in patients with high grade glioma. Armodafinil may help relieve

      fatigue in patients with high grade glioma.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Patients experiencing fatigue related to cancer will be asked to take part in this study.

      Cancer-related fatigue is a very common symptom in patients with cancer. Patients will

      receive armodafinil or placebo. Please see the "Arms" section for more details regarding the

      treatment assignments. The primary objective of this study is to determine preliminary

      efficacy measured by patient reported fatigue Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) at 8 weeks of

      two doses (150 mg and 250 mg) of armodafinil in treating moderate fatigue compared to

      placebo in patients with high grade glioma.



      The secondary objectives of the study are listed below.



        1. To evaluate the tolerability at 8 weeks of 150 mg and 250 mg armodafinil in this

           patient population.



        2. To assess the effect of armodafinil at 8 weeks on cognitive function in patients with

           high grade glioma.



        3. To assess the impact of armodafinil on global quality of life and other fatigue

           endpoints in this patient population with high grade glioma.



        4. Explore the correlation between the BFI, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement

           Information System (PROMIS), and Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common

           Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) measures, as well as, the

           relationship of fatigue and cognitive difficulties.



      Patients will receive armodafinil or placebo for a total of 8 weeks.

    <brief_summary>

      The standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer involves chemotherapy and

      radiation, known as 5FUCMT, (the chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine and

      radiation therapy) prior to surgery. Although radiation therapy to the pelvis has been a

      standard and important part of treatment for rectal cancer and has been shown to decrease

      the risk of the cancer coming back in the same area in the pelvis, some patients experience

      undesirable side effects from the radiation and there have been important advances in

      chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation which may be of benefit. The purpose of this study is

      to compare the effects, both good and bad, of the standard treatment of chemotherapy and

      radiation to chemotherapy using a combination regimen known as FOLFOX, (the drugs

      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin and leucovorin) and selective use of the standard

      treatment, depending on response to the FOLFOX. The drugs in the FOLFOX regimen are all FDA

      (Food and Drug Administration) approved and have been used routinely to treat patients with

      advanced colorectal cancer.

    <detailed_description>

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase II/III study. Patients are stratified according to

      ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens. Patients

      will receive full supportive care while on this study.



      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        1. Phase II component: To assure that neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of

           5FUCMT group (Group 1) maintains the current high rate of pelvic R0 resection and is

           consistent with non-inferiority for time to local recurrence (TLR).



        2. Phase III component: To compare neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of 5FUCMT

           (Group 1) to standard 5FUCMT (Group 2) with respect to the co-primary endpoints of the

           Time to Local Recurrence (TLR) and Disease-Free Survival (DFS).



      Secondary



        1. To determine if the neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of 5FUCMT (Group 1) is

           non-inferior to the standard group 5FUCMT (Group 2) with respect to the proportion of

           patients who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of surgical

           resection.



        2. To determine if the neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of 5FUCMT (Group 1) is

           non-inferior to the standard 5FUCMT (Group 2) with respect to overall survival.



        3. To evaluate and compare the adverse event profile and surgery complications between two

           groups.



        4. To estimate the proportion of patients in the selective group (Group 1) who receive: 1)

           pre-operative 5FUCMT; 2) post-operative 5FUCMT; 3) either pre- or post-operative

           5FUCMT.



      Event monitoring of patients will continue up to 8 years post randomization.

    <brief_summary>

      Current islet transplantation into the portal vein of the liver has shown the unique ability

      of islets to stabilize blood glucose levels and prevent severe hypoglycemia in a selected

      group of subjects with Type 1 diabetes. The main limitations of islet transplantation are

      the need for systemic immunosuppression to maintain function and the loss of islet function

      over time. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated that the current site of

      transplantation in the liver is not an ideal site due to several factors. These factors

      include (1) significant liver inflammation following islet infusion; (2) potential for

      life-threatening procedure-related complications such as bleeding and thrombosis; (3) high

      levels of immunosuppressive drugs and GI toxins in the liver contributing to islet toxicity;

      (4) the inability to retrieve islets after infusion; and (5) development of graft

      dysfunction in a number of recipients of intrahepatic allogeneic and autologous islets. The

      implantation of islets into the omentum will allow adequate engraftment of islets onto the

      omentum and will lead to comparable or superior functional and clinical outcomes than in the

      traditional intrahepatic site.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Islet transplantation will be performed in subjects with unstable Type 1 diabetes mellitus

      under permanent immunosuppression. Islets are re-suspended in autologous plasma and

      distributed on the omental surface by a minimal invasive approach. Cell adherence is

      achieved by addition of clinical-grade recombinant human thrombin that reacts with plasma to

      create a biocompatible, degradable gel containing the islet graft. The primary efficacy

      endpoint is the proportion of subjects with HbA1c ≤6.5% at 1 year AND free of severe

      hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 365, inclusive, after the islet transplant. The

      primary safety endpoint is to demonstrate patient safety throughout all stages of the trial.

    <brief_summary>

      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a diverse disease that is fatal in the majority of patients.

      Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) however, a subtype of AML accounting for 5% of all cases,

      is very curable. APL cells are highly sensitive to the retinoid all-trans-retinoic acid

      (ATRA), which effectively differentiates the leukemic clone. Over 80% of APL patients can be

      cured with ATRA based therapies. For patients with non-APL AML, ATRA has little effect.

      Consequently, 85% of these patients will succumb to their disease despite conventional

      approaches. Little is known about mechanisms of resistance to ATRA in non-APL AML. This

      knowledge gap limits the use of ATRA in a disease that already has few effective therapies.

      The investigators' preliminary data suggest that non-APL AML cells can be re-sensitized to

      ATRA when combined with lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD 1) inhibitors. The investigators'

      publication in Nature Medicine showed that LSD1 inhibition with tranylcypromine (TCP),

      unlocked the ATRA-driven therapeutic response in non-APL AML. Notably, treatment with ATRA

      and TCP markedly diminished the engraftment of primary human AML cells in murine models,

      indicating that the combination may target leukemia-initiating cells (LIC). The

      investigators' data identify LSD1 as a therapeutic target and strongly suggest that it may

      contribute to ATRA resistance in non-APL AML. The investigators' central hypothesis is that

      ATRA combined with TCP will be safe and effective in a clinical population, and that this

      approach will suppress LICs and restore myeloid differentiation programs in patients with

      non-APL AML. Testing this hypothesis with the phase I clinical trial outlined in this

      protocol, will establish a new treatment paradigm in AML and extend the important

      anti-cancer effects of ATRA to all AML subtypes.

    <brief_summary>

      This observational trial studies how well surgery to remove the tumor and lymph nodes,

      and/or radiation therapy work in treating patients with early-stage vulvar cancer.

      Observation is closely monitoring a patient's condition and not giving treatment until

      symptoms appear or change. Observation may help doctors see how effective surgery and/or

      radiation therapy are in treating vulvar cancer.

    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To investigate the safety of replacing complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy by

      adjuvant radiotherapy in early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a sentinel node metastasis

      ≤ 2 mm.



      II. To evaluate the short- and long-term morbidity associated with the sentinel lymph node

      procedure and adjuvant (chemo) radiotherapy.



      III. To further establish the safety of omitting complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in

      patients with a negative sentinel node.



      IV. To explore the efficacy, safety, and short- and long-term morbidity of inguinofemoral

      lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy in patients with sentinel node metastasis &gt; 2 mm.

      (exploratory)



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.



      Patients undergo planned radical vulvectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection. Patients

      without lymph node involvement undergo observation. Patients with minimal lymph node

      involvement undergo radiotherapy. Patients with significant lymph node involvement undergo

      inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy according to

      institutional guidelines.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years.

      Follow-up includes interview, gynecological examination, and palpation of the groins.

    <brief_summary>

      In summary, the overall prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) patients remains poor. Although

      clinical gains have been achieved in the past, these have been modest, with a majority of

      patients succumbing to local disease progression within 2 years. New strategies for

      treatment need to be identified which enhance local control above the current treatment

      regimen in order to achieve further clinical gains in this disease. Favorable early

      experience with magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) demonstrates that metabolic

      imaging can identify active tumor beyond standard MRI as well as high risk regions at risk

      for local failure. There is also clinical evidence that limited field dose escalation with

      either simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is feasible

      and safe. Coupling these findings provide the rationale for this proposed Phase II trial

      designed to define efficacy and toxicity of the novel treatment approach of whole brain

      volumetric 3D MRSI guided dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) in newly diagnosed GBM

      patients.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride compared to placebo

      works in treating patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has been

      completely removed by surgery. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by

      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To assess whether adjuvant therapy with erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) will result

      in improved overall survival (OS) over placebo for patients with completely resected stage

      IB (&gt;= 4 cm)-IIIA epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer

      (NSCLC) (confirmed centrally) following complete resection and standard post-operative

      therapy.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To assess whether adjuvant therapy with erlotinib will result in improved disease free

      survival (DFS) over placebo for patients with completely resected stage IB (&gt;= 4 cm)-IIIA

      EGFR mutant NSCLC (confirmed centrally) following complete resection and standard

      post-operative therapy, both overall and within the stage subgroups: IB and II/IIIA.



      II. To evaluate the safety profile of erlotinib in the adjuvant setting. III. To assess

      whether adjuvant therapy with erlotinib will result in improved DFS rate at 2 years, and OS

      rate at 5 and 10 years over placebo for patients with completely resected stage IB (&gt;= 4

      cm)-IIIA EGFR mutant NSCLC (confirmed centrally) following complete resection and standard

      post-operative therapy, both overall and within the stage subgroups: IB and II/IIIA.



      IV. To assess the primary and secondary objectives in all randomized patients, regardless of

      central confirmation of the EGFR mutant status.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or

      unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up

      to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 4 years and

      then yearly for 6 years.

    <brief_summary>

      This research trial studies genetic testing in screening patients with stage IB-IIIA

      non-small cell lung cancer that has been or will be removed by surgery. Studying the genes

      in a patient's tumor cells may help doctors select the best treatment for patients that have

      certain genetic changes.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To centrally test resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for genetic mutations to

      facilitate accrual to randomized adjuvant studies.



      II. To obtain clinically annotated tumor tissue and patient-matched non-malignant

      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from peripheral blood, as well as detailed epidemiologic and

      clinical follow-up data, to allow clinically annotated advanced genomic analyses in concert

      with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To characterize the natural history of molecularly characterized NSCLC to allow

      subsequent development of targeted therapies against genotype-defined subpopulations in the

      adjuvant and recurrent settings.



      II. To cross-validate local genotyping assays for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)

      and anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) with a central reference standard.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To study the genomic evolution of lung cancers by comparing genomic characteristics at

      resection and at recurrence.



      II. To understand reasons behind lack of enrollment to adjuvant targeted therapy studies for

      potentially eligible patients.



      OUTLINE:



      Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for EGFR, ALK, and programmed cell

      death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/cytotoxic

      t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) testing via direct sequencing, fluorescence in

      situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients that have had surgery

      prior to pre-registration will submit samples from the previous surgery for testing.



      After completion of study, patients that are not enrolled on either A081105, E4512, or

      EA5142 are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.

    <brief_summary>

      This study aims to determine the performance of the Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test to

      detect colorectal cancer (CRC) and colorectal neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel

      disease (IBD). Patients with an IBD diagnosis for at least eight years or diagnosis of

      primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and who are eligible for CRC screening are eligible to

      participate in this study. Enrolled subjects will collect a stool sample for the Exact

      IBD-ACRN surveillance test. Subjects must have undergone colonoscopy no more than 90 days

      prior to enrollment and will undergo colonoscopy or surgical intervention within 120 days of

      enrollment. Tissue diagnosis of CRC will be established by histopathologic examination.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, cross sectional, multi-center study to determine the sensitivity and

      specificity of the Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test for detecting CRC alone and in

      combination with high grade dysplasia (HGD) and low grade dysplasia (LGD) associated with

      IBD and advanced adenoma in IBD patients with disease duration greater than 8 years or PSC

      diagnosis. Enrolled subjects will provide a single stool sample for the Exact IBD-ACRN

      surveillance test, no sooner than 7 days following their most recent pre-enrollment

      colonoscopy, within 30 days of enrollment and prior to initiating bowel prep for either the

      post-enrollment colonoscopy (surveillance or repeat), or surgical intervention. Stool

      samples will be tested using the Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test and results compared to

      the colonoscopy and corresponding diagnostic histopathology results from biopsied, and any

      subsequently excised, lesions to establish sensitivity and specificity of the Exact IBD-ACRN

      surveillance test. All post-enrollment colonoscopies or surgical interventions must be

      performed within 60 days of enrollment.



      The primary objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the

      Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test for CRC in IBD patients with disease duration of at least

      eight years or diagnosis of PSC. Tissue diagnosis of CRC will be established by

      histopathology examination. The secondary objective is to determine the sensitivity and

      specificity of the Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test to detect ACRN in IBD patients with

      disease duration of at least eight years or diagnosis of PSC.



      Enrollment will continue until at least 35 CRC; 15 HGD and 315 negative subject samples have

      been obtained. There is no specific recruitment goal for IBD associated LGD or LGD

      associated with advanced adenoma (AA).

    <brief_summary>

      Recent reports have identified a specific oncogenic mutation L265P of the MYD88 gene in

      approximately 90% of the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88 is a key

      linker protein in the signaling pathway of Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) 7, 8, and 9, and

      IMO-8400 is an oligonucleotide specifically designed to inhibit TLRs 7,8, and 9. The

      scientific hypothesis for use of IMO-8400 to treat patients with Waldenström's

      macroglobulinemia depends on the inhibition of mutant MYD88 signaling in the TLR pathway,

      thereby interrupting the proliferation of cell populations responsible for the propagation

      of the disease.

      The purpose of this registry is to collect information on patients who are receiving

      treatment with Proleukin in an organized way, and to learn more about patient care during

      and after treatment.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The PROCLAIM Registry is a US-based, multicenter Registry designed to establish a high

      quality observational database of real-world clinical data on HD IL-2 when used to treat

      patients with mRCC, mM or other malignancies. The Registry will not, in any way, suggest

      changes in the treatment or management of the patients enrolled in the Registry. Therefore,

      physicians will continue to manage and treat patients according to standard of care and

      their own judgment.



      The PROCLAIM Registry will start with a retrospective pilot data collection from a

      de-identified finite number of patient cases abstracted from their existing medical charts.

      The features collected will be identical to those planned for the prospective registry. The

      resulting database will be used to formulate hypotheses to be tested using the prospective

      registry database. Patients utilized in the retrospective analysis will be excluded from the

      prospective portion of the Registry.



      In the prospective portion of the Registry, sites will enroll patients who are expected to

      start a course of HD IL-2 therapy. Once enrolled, the patient must receive at least one dose

      of HD IL-2 to remain in the Registry. Patients will be treated and followed according to the

      site's standard of care. This Registry will in no way induce changes in the management of

      individual patients. Clinical data features will be entered into an Electronic Data Capture

      (EDC) system, and organized into a registry database.



      The data contained in the registry database will be observational data. The PROCLAIM

      Registry does not stipulate patient care, specific visits or interventions but merely

      surveys standardized parameters regarding HD IL-2 and associated therapies as they are

      applied by treatment centers. The collection of standard data over time permits the

      evaluation of trends in patient survival and subsequent therapy exposure. The database will

      be used to answer future queries formulated by researchers.

    <brief_summary>

      The overall goal of Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury

      (TRACK-TBI) study is to determine the relationships among the clinical, neuroimaging,

      cognitive, genetic and proteomic biomarker characteristics for the entire spectrum of TBI

      from concussion to coma. TRACK-TBI will validate biomarkers and outcome measures for

      clinical trials, advance diagnostic and prognostic models for TBI and improve clinical trial

      design.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Effective treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the greatest unmet needs

      in public health. After 3 decades of failed clinical trials, a new approach is needed. Our

      proposal, Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury

      (TRACK-TBI), establishes a public-private partnership of experienced TBI investigators, and

      philanthropic and industry collaborators, who share a mission to accelerate TBI research.

      TRACK-TBI will create a large, high quality database that integrates clinical, imaging,

      proteomic, genomic, and outcome biomarkers to establish more precise methods for TBI

      diagnosis and prognosis, refine outcome assessment, and compare the effectiveness and costs

      of TBI care.



      We hypothesize that this approach will permit investigators to better characterize and

      stratify patients, allow meaningful comparisons of treatments and outcomes, and improve the

      next generation of clinical trials. We have built on the TRACK-TBI Pilot study (NCT01565551)

      and our team's precompetitive collaboration, forged by participation in the TBI Common Data

      Elements project (TBI-CDE) and the International TBI Research Initiative (InTBIR). Having

      provided the index dataset for the Federal Interagency TBI Research database (FITBIR), we

      now propose the following Specific Aims:



      Specific Aim 1. To create a widely accessible, comprehensive TBI Information Commons that

      integrates clinical, imaging, proteomic, genomic, and outcome biomarkers from subjects

      across the age and injury spectra, and provides analytic tools and resources to support TBI

      research. Multi- disciplinary teams across 11 sites will enroll 3000 subjects of all ages

      across the injury spectrum of concussion to coma. Utilizing TBI-CDEs, along with uniform

      standards for acquiring multi-site MRI data, we will expand the TRACK-TBI Pilot informatics

      platform, leveraging existing informatics tools to populate FITBIR, yielding a resource for

      current and future TBI research and international collaboration.



      Specific Aim 2. To validate imaging, proteomic, and genetic biomarkers that will improve

      classification of TBI, permit appropriate selection and stratification of patients for

      clinical trials, and contribute to the development of a new taxonomy for TBI. We hypothesize

      that validated imaging, proteomic, and genetic biomarkers will permit improved patient

      classification, beyond traditional categories of mild, moderate and severe TBI.



      Subaim 2.1. To establish prognostic imaging biomarkers for TBI based on patho-anatomic

      analysis of CT and MRI, as well as quantitative MR volumetrics, diffusion tensor imaging

      (DTI), and resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI).



      Subaim 2.2. To identify blood-based biomarkers that will provide additional diagnostic and

      prognostic information with which to identify TBI phenotypes that can be targeted by

      specific therapies.



      Subaim 2.3. To identify common polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with outcome

      after TBI, and to elucidate causal molecular mechanisms of injury, response, and repair.



      Subaim 2.4. To construct a multidimensional TBI classification system incorporating data

      from multiple domains that will define homogeneous classes of patients suitable for clinical

      trial inclusion.



      Specific Aim 3. To evaluate a flexible outcome assessment battery comprised of a broad range

      of TBI common data elements that enables assessment of multiple outcome domains across all

      phases of recovery and at all levels of TBI severity. When compared with the current gold

      standard, the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), we hypothesize that a flexible and more

      discriminating outcome battery reflecting multiple functional domains will more precisely

      and efficiently capture outcomes across the course of recovery, at all levels of TBI

      severity.



      Subaim 3.1. To improve the granularity and breadth of TBI outcomes using a flexible outcome

      assessment battery that enables basic neurocognitive assessment in subjects too impaired to

      undergo standard neuropsychological testing, and comprehensive assessment of cognition,

      functional status, mental health, social participation, and quality of life in those

      cognitively intact enough to provide valid results.



      Subaim 3.2. To determine the efficiency of a flexible outcome assessment battery, as

      compared with the GOSE, in reducing sample sizes needed to detect differences between

      groups.



      Subaim 3.3. To identify specific TBI phenotypes amenable to targeted interventions, by

      relating patient classification factors (Subaim 2.4) to different outcome factor scores

      (Subaim 3.1).



      Specific Aim 4. To determine which tests, treatments, and services are effective and

      appropriate for which TBI patients, and use this evidence to recommend practices that offer

      the best value. We will use established comparative effectiveness research (CER) and health

      economics methods to evaluate the ability of each clinical practice to improve outcomes

      while containing costs.



      Subaim 4.1. To identify patients currently admitted to an ICU who could be safely and

      effectively cared for in a floor bed or discharged home with outpatient management, and to

      estimate the health and economic impact of changing the management of these patients.



      Subaim 4.2. To determine whether routine follow up improves TBI outcomes and minimizes their

      economic burden.



      Subaim 4.3. To assess variability in management of patients taking antiplatelet agents at

      the time of TBI, and the effect of management on progression of intracranial hemorrhage,

      need for craniotomy, and outcome.



      We expect that achievement of these Specific Aims will advance our understanding of TBI,

      improve clinical trial design, lead to more effective patient-specific treatments, and

      improve outcome after TBI.

    <brief_summary>

      The Sponsor values the progression of hearing healthcare practice and acknowledges a need

      for re-evaluation of indications for determining adult cochlear implant candidacy. This need

      arises from current research, peer reviewed literature, and technological advancement with

      concomitant performance outcomes. To address this specifically, the Sponsor proposes to

      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Cochlear™ Nucleus® implant system with a revised

      indication.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Existing research, as discussed, supports the opinion that current candidacy criteria are

      set conservatively. The Sponsor, in addition to the support of recent peer reviewed

      literature illustrating a need for an appropriate criteria and more suitable speech

      recognition measure, believe it is appropriate at this time to re-evaluate the candidacy

      requirements associated with adult cochlear implantation. Specifically, this will be

      accomplished by evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Cochlear™ Nucleus® cochlear

      implant system under revised cochlear implant indications. The proposed approach would be to

      evaluate individuals scoring between 10 - 40% inclusively on Consonant Nucleus Consonant

      (CNC) monosyllabic words who do not meet current approved speech perception criteria with

      the widely used sentence measure Hearing In Noise Test (HINT) in quiet. No change to current

      qualifying audiometric criteria (bilateral moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss

      in the low frequencies and profound hearing loss in the mid to high speech frequencies) for

      implant candidacy is proposed.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to find out if aldehyde dehydrogenase bright (ALDHbr) cells

      taken from a patient's bone marrow can be placed safely, via intramuscular injections, into

      their affected calf and lower thigh muscles and improve blood flow and/or peak walking time

      in patients experiencing pain associated with blocked blood vessels in the leg.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) occurs when arteries in the arms and legs (most often the

      legs) become narrowed by plaque. Because of this plaque, patients with PAD are also at

      increased risk for heart attacks and strokes. Those with PAD often have intermittent

      claudication (blockage of blood vessels in the leg). This blockage decreases blood flow to

      the leg muscles, which can cause pain in one or both legs during exercise (such as during

      walking). Intermittent means the pain comes and goes. Because PAD interferes with

      circulation, worsening of this condition can increase pain in the leg; sometimes even during

      periods of rest.



      Bone marrow contains special stem cells that may promote blood vessel growth, prevent cell

      death, and transform themselves into a number of tissues including new muscle. There is a

      small subpopulation of bone marrow mononuclear cells, called aldehyde dehydrogenase-bright

      (ALDHbr) cells, that is highly enriched in these types of stem cells. The enzyme in ALDHbr

      cells responds to damage signals and may play an important role in tissue repair.



      In this study we investigate the safety and efficacy of bone marrow derived stem cells with

      particular characteristics in PAD patients with intermittent claudication and explore new

      end-points to evaluate therapeutic effects using novel MRI imaging modalities as well as

      traditional endpoints.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pre-operative prostate artery embolization

      (PAE) reduces intra-operative blood loss and improves surgical outcomes among prostate

      cancer patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Duration of study:



      This study will enroll 20 patients, with a target enrollment period of 18 months. Patients

      who undergo prostate artery embolization (PAE) will have follow-up visits 2 weeks and 6

      weeks after PAE. All patients in the study will have post RALRP follow-up visits at 2 weeks,

      3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after surgery. All patients will continue to be

      followed according to the usual standard of care following the completion of the study.



      Study design:



      The first 10 patients who meet all study eligibility criteria and provide consent for

      participation in the study will receive PAE prior to RALRP. Control patients will be matched

      1:1 to PAE patients, according to risk score, and will receive RALRP without PAE. Control

      patients will be selected after all PAE patients have been enrolled, and need not meet all

      study eligibility criteria.



      The following assessments and evaluations are required for participation in this study:



      Physical exams, blood &amp; urine tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital rectal exams

      (DREs), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)

      questionnaires, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires,

      robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP), and pad weight tests. All

      patients enrolled in the PAE arm of the study will undergo embolization of the blood vessels

      that feed the prostate.

      1. Multiparametric MRIus-guided or direct MRI-guided biopsies will allow for more directed

           sampling of the tumors from compartments with distinct MP-MRI characteristics, termed

           habitats, that will increase the rate of "progression" on early (first and second)

           surveillance biopsies and decrease the rate of "progression" on late (third and

           further) surveillance biopsies compared to historic TRUS-guided biopsy rates.



        2. Radiomics signatures from MP-MRI will define patterns that are associated with

           progression.



        3. Genomic signatures based on RNA from tumor tissue will define patterns that are

           associated with habitats and radiomics signatures, as well as progression.

    <detailed_description>

      Single arm therapeutic trial investigating the impact of MRI and MRI-US fusion biopsy to

      identify higher grade or volume tumors early on for better selection of patients for active

      surveillance. MRI-US fusion biopsy will include targeting of suspicious areas seen on MRI as

      well as segmented sampling of the remaining gland. Patients will undergo MRI and MRI-US

      fusion biopsy within 3 months of enrollment in the trial and have repeat MRI-US fusion

      biopsies every year to assess overall rates and the temporal distribution of progression.

      Serum, urine and prostate biopsy tissue will be serially collected to investigate the

      association between various molecular biomarkers and radiologic and histological

      progression.



      The research study will end at 36 months from the initial protocol biopsy. Duration of study

      treatment will be a maximum of 42 months from enrollment and four biopsies for patients who

      do not progress. After the end of study, the patient will be followed, if consented, in the

      department of Urology active surveillance database as per their clinician's standard of

      care.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies exemestane and entinostat to see how well they work

      compared to exemestane alone in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive breast

      cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or another place in the body.

      Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy using exemestane may

      fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Entinostat may stop

      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not

      yet known whether exemestane is more effective with or without entinostat in treating breast

      cancer.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to endocrine therapy (exemestane) improves

      progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in patients with hormone

      receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally

      advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have previously progressed on a non-steroidal

      aromatase inhibitor (Al).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with exemestane, and

      to compare the safety profile to that of endocrine therapy with placebo.



      II. To evaluate the objective response rate of exemestane in combination with entinostat or

      placebo.



      III. To evaluate whether the efficacy of exemestane with entinostat varies with changes in

      acetylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).



      IV. To evaluate the time to treatment deterioration (as defined by decrease in

      health-related quality of life [HRQL], progression, death) of exemestane + entinostat versus

      exemestane + placebo arms.



      V. To evaluate the differences in overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) between the

      exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.



      VI. To evaluate the difference with respect to specific symptoms that are associated with

      entinostat, i.e., fatigue, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea, between the exemestane +

      entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.



      VII. To measure adherence to protocol therapy.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To collect archival tumor samples and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to explore

      other potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.



      II. To collect patient ratings of adverse events (AEs) using select patient-reported

      outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) items to evaluate the

      psychometric properties of PRO-CTCAE items and explore the incorporation of PRO-CTCAE items

      into a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM A: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and entinostat

      PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease

      progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM B: Patients receive exemestane as in Arm A and placebo PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      In both arms, pre/perimenopausal female patients and all male patients also receive

      goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,

      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

    <brief_summary>

      The specific primary objective of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and

      beneficial therapeutic for Myasthenia Gravis (MG) that warrants further study in a phase III

      efficacy trial.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Investigators plan on conducting a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled

      Phase II clinical trial utilizing a futility design. The study would include acetylcholine

      receptor (AChR) antibody positive generalized MG subjects. This study also presents a unique

      opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune

      diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific

      components that participate in the immunopathology of the disease, namely autoantibodies,

      autoantibody-producing B cells, and antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our

      understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more

      complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab

      leading to new ways to treat the disease.



      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and effective

      treatment for subjects with MG.

          2. Subjects must have generalized MG, defined as MGFA clinical classification grades 2

             (mild), 3 (moderate), or 4 (severe, but not intubated) at the time of

             screening/randomization.



          3. Elevated AChR antibody titer



          4. Subject's signs and symptoms should not be better explained by another disease

             process.

               1. Prednisone only: Prednisone dose must be at least 15mg/day (or the equivalent on

                  alternate days), and the dose of prednisone must have been stable for at least 4

                  weeks (28 days) prior to the baseline visit.



               2. Prednisone plus another immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Immunosuppressive

                  therapies other than prednisone, specifically azathioprine, mycophenolate

                  mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus or methotrexate, are permitted, but the dose

                  must have been stable for at least 6 months prior to the baseline visit.



             (Note: The prednisone dose must be stable as defined in the prednisone only group.

    <brief_summary>

      The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of stroke in patients with

      Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease (IAD) by specifically evaluating limitations of

      antegrade flow through the stenotic artery, distal tissue perfusion to the affected

      territory, and artery-to-artery embolism. The hypothesis is that non-invasive imaging

      biomarkers that stratify stroke risk and distinguish mechanisms of IAD. This prospective

      multicenter study will enroll 175 patients with recently symptomatic high-grade IAD.

      Patients will be studied within 21 days of the index event (allowing appropriate time to

      arrange for diverse imaging modalities), with the following advanced neuroimaging techniques

      to elucidate mechanisms of recurrent ischemia:



        -  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (QMRA) to assess volumetric flow rate through

           the stenotic artery.



        -  Magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging (PWI-MRI) to determine distal tissue

           perfusion.



        -  Vasomotor reactivity by Transcranial Doppler using the breath-holding technique

           (BHI-TCD) to assess compensatory flow characteristics to the territory distal to the

           affected artery;



        -  Transcranial Doppler with embolic signal monitoring to evaluate artery-to-artery

           embolism that reflects plaque instability.



      Patients will receive standardized medical management and its effectiveness on blood

      pressure, lipid, and glycemic control will be monitored.



      The primary outcome is recurrent stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery during a

      1-year follow-up period; secondary outcomes are: a) new asymptomatic ischemic lesions on MRI

      in the distribution of the stenotic artery at 6-8 weeks, and b) transient ischemic attack

      (TIA) in the distribution of the stenotic artery during a 1-year follow-up period.



      Patients will be recruited at various sites that will be trained and certified on the

      imaging techniques employed. Raw imaging data will be interpreted centrally.

      To compare the efficacy of 2 fixed doses of brexpiprazole with placebo in subjects with

      agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, are core features in subjects with Alzheimer's

      disease and related dementias and develop in the majority of dementia subjects. The presence

      of agitation in subjects with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden not only on

      subjects and their caregivers but also on the healthcare system.



      This is a trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in the treatment

      of subjects with agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. The trial

      consists of a continuous 12-week double-blind treatment period with a 30-day follow-up. The

      trial population will include male and female subjects between 55 and 90 years of age

      (inclusive) with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, who are residing either in an

      institutionalized setting or in a non-institutionalized setting where the subject is not

      living alone.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the use of NAC in the treatment of anosmia

      (a loss of the sense of smell). This drug is already approved by the Food and Drug

      Administration (FDA) for oral or pulmonary (lung) inhaled use for other medical conditions.

      However, there is research evidence that the medication may promote nerve recovery (help

      nerves work better after they are damaged). Since anosmia involves nerve problems, we

      believe the nasal spray may help treat anosmia. The medication has been in use for many

      years for other conditions, without safety problems.

    <brief_summary>

      This trial will be a phase 2 randomized safety study in which ischemic stroke patients will

      be randomly assigned within 24 hours of symptom onset to placebo or standard dose lovastatin

      versus short-term high-dose lovastatin 640 mg per day for 3 days. The primary outcome of

      this Phase 2 study will be musculoskeletal and hepatic toxicity, defined by clinical and

      laboratory criteria, with a 3-month follow-up period (± 1 week). Secondary outcomes will

      include neurological outcome (National Institute of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale), functional

      outcomes (Barthel Index), and handicap (modified Rankin scores). Effects on inflammatory

      markers and lipid levels will also be assessed.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a phase 2 randomized, blinded and controlled safety study in patients with ischemic

      stroke. The time window for enrollment will be within 0-24 hours of symptom onset. For

      patients who are found with the stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke

      occurred the last time that the patient was known to be normal. All patients will be

      identified by the stroke acute care team in the emergency room of the participating centers,

      or in some cases, on the floor services of the hospital (i.e., for patients with stroke

      occurring in hospital). If preliminary data indicate that the patient meets eligibility

      criteria the patient (or legally authorized representative) will be approached about

      participation in the study, and consent obtained. Surrogate consent will be allowed at

      centers at which this is permitted according to regulations. Patients who are consented

      through a surrogate and subsequently regain capacity, will be approached and reconsented to

      continue in the study.



      The intervention chosen for this trial is either (1) placebo for patients not taking a

      statin at the time of admission OR lovastatin 80 mg in place of their regular statin for

      patients taking a statin (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin,

      lovastatin) at time of enrolment VERSUS (2) oral lovastatin at dosage of 640 mg daily for 3

      days. The time of first dose will be considered time 0. Patients will be administered the

      total daily dose in four daily divided doses (i.e., QID schedule). After the initial 3 days

      of acute dosage, all patients will receive statin therapy at the discretion of their

      treating physician.

    <detailed_description>

      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease

      characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary

      insufficiency eventually resulting in death. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

      (IPF) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and

      non-productive cough, often accompanied by digital clubbing. Due to the insidious onset of

      symptoms, however, most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after

      significant fibrosis has occurred. Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia, "dry"

      inspiratory crackles on auscultation, and occasional digital clubbing (6). Pulmonary

      function tests (PFTs) usually reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of

      forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and six-minute walk distances.

      Diagnosis is established by the pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia (with sub

      epithelial fibroblastic foci) by open lung biopsy (7), and/or by high resolution CT (HRCT)

      demonstrating the characteristic findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular

      changes with fibrosis, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis (8, 9).



      The prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is uniformly poor. The

      natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline

      interspersed with "exacerbations" or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal

      (5). There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary

      Fibrosis (IPF) and thus no standard of care. In cases of patients under the age of 60 with

      limited comorbid disease, lung transplant may be offered. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary

      Fibrosis (IPF) receive empiric treatment, supportive care alone, and more recently, are

      offered enrollment in clinical trials.



      The pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by epithelial cell

      injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with

      extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and eventual loss of function. Because mesenchymal

      stem cells are known to home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to

      epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment

      of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

      This randomized phase III trial studies standard or comprehensive radiation therapy in

      treating patients with early-stage breast cancer who have undergone surgery. Radiation

      therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether

      comprehensive radiation therapy is more effective than standard radiation therapy in

      treating patients with breast cancer

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      To evaluate whether the addition of chest wall + regional nodal radiation therapy (XRT)

      after mastectomy or breast + regional nodal XRT after breast conserving surgery will

      significantly reduce the rate of events for invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval

      (IBC-RFI) in patients who present with histologically positive axillary nodes but convert to

      histologically negative axillary nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate whether the addition of chest wall + regional nodal XRT after mastectomy or

      breast + regional nodal XRT after breast conserving surgery will significantly prolong

      overall survival (OS) in patients who present with histologically positive axillary nodes

      but convert to histologically negative axillary nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.



      II. To evaluate whether the addition of chest wall + regional nodal XRT after mastectomy or

      breast + regional nodal XRT after breast conserving surgery will significantly reduce the

      rates of events for local-regional recurrence-free interval (LRRFI) in patients who present

      with histologically positive axillary nodes but convert to histologically negative axillary

      nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.



      III. To evaluate whether the addition of chest wall + regional nodal XRT after mastectomy or

      breast + regional nodal XRT after breast conserving surgery will significantly reduce the

      rate of events for distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) in patients who present with

      histologically positive axillary nodes but convert to histologically negative axillary nodes

      following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.



      IV. To compare the rates of disease-free survival (DFS)-ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by

      treatment arm.



      V. To compare the rates of second primary cancer (SPC) by treatment arm.



      VI. To compare the effect of adding XRT on the cosmetic outcomes in mastectomy patients who

      have had reconstruction.



      VII. To compare the effect of adding XRT on quality of life including arm problems,

      lymphedema, pain, and fatigue.



      VIII. To evaluate the toxicity associated with each of the radiation therapy regimens.



      IX. To determine whether computed tomography (CT)-based conformal methods

      (intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT] and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy

      [3DCRT]) for chestwall + regional nodal XRT post mastectomy and regional nodal XRT with

      breast XRT following breast conserving surgery are feasible in a multi-institutional setting

      and whether dose-volume analyses can be established to assess treatment adequacy and to

      develop normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for the likelihood of toxicity.



      X. To compare the effect of XRT in patients receiving mastectomy and in patients receiving

      lumpectomy.



      XI. To examine the role of proliferation measures as a prognosticator for patients with

      residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.



      XII. To develop predictors of the degree of reduction in local regional recurrence (LRR).



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM 1: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.



      GROUP 1A: Lumpectomy patients undergo whole breast radiation therapy using IMRT or 3DCRT

      once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks followed by a radiation therapy boost to the lumpectomy

      cavity once daily 5 days a week for 1-1/2 weeks.



      GROUP 1B: Mastectomy patients do not undergo radiation therapy.



      ARM 2: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.



      GROUP 2A: Lumpectomy patients undergo regional nodal radiation therapy with whole breast

      radiation therapy using IMRT or 3DCRT once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks followed by a

      radiation therapy boost to the lumpectomy cavity once daily 5 days a week for 1-1/2 weeks.



      GROUP 2B: Mastectomy patients undergo regional nodal radiation therapy and chestwall XRT

      using IMRT or 3DCRT once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks.



      All patients also receive systemic therapy as planned (hormonal therapy for patients with

      hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and trastuzumab or other anti-human epidermal growth

      factor receptor 2 [HER2] therapy for patients with breast cancer that is HER2-positive).



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months

      and then yearly for 8 years.

          -  The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status

             of 0 or 1



          -  Patient must have clinically T1-3, N1 breast cancer at the time of diagnosis (before

             neoadjuvant therapy); clinical axillary nodal involvement can be assessed by

             palpation, ultrasound, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission

             tomography (PET) scan, or PET/CT scan



          -  Patient must have had pathologic confirmation of axillary nodal involvement at

             presentation (before neoadjuvant therapy) based on either a positive fine needle

             aspirate (FNA) (demonstrating malignant cells) or positive core needle biopsy

             (demonstrating invasive adenocarcinoma); the FNA or core needle biopsy can be

             performed either by palpation or by image guidance; documentation of axillary nodal

             positivity by sentinel node biopsy (before neoadjuvant therapy) is not permitted



          -  Patients must have had estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary

             breast tumor before neoadjuvant therapy according to current American Society of

             Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guideline

             recommendations for hormone receptor testing; if negative for ER, assessment of

             progesterone receptor (PgR) must also be performed according to current ASCO/CAP

             guideline recommendations for hormone receptor testing (http://www.asco.org)



          -  Patients must have had HER2 testing performed on the primary breast tumor before

             neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the current ASCO/CAP guideline recommendations

             for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in Breast Cancer

             (http://www.asco.org); patients who have a primary tumor that is either HER2-positive

             or HER2-negative are eligible



          -  Patient must have completed a minimum of 12 weeks of standard neoadjuvant

             chemotherapy consisting of an anthracycline and/or taxane-based regimen



          -  For patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery, a maximum of 12 weeks

             of intended chemotherapy may be administered but must be completed before

             randomization; (if treatment delays occur, chemotherapy must be completed within 14

             weeks); the dose and schedule of the adjuvant chemotherapy are at the investigator's

             discretion; Note: It is preferred that all intended chemotherapy be administered in

             the neoadjuvant setting



          -  Patients with HER2-positive tumors must have received neoadjuvant trastuzumab or

             other anti-HER2 therapy (either with all or with a portion of the neoadjuvant

             chemotherapy regimen), unless medically contraindicated



          -  At the time of definitive surgery, all removed axillary nodes must be histologically

             free from cancer; acceptable procedures for assessment of axillary nodal status at

             the time of surgery include:



               -  Axillary node dissection



               -  Sentinel node biopsy alone or



               -  Sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary node dissection



               -  Note: Patients are eligible whether there is residual invasive carcinoma in the

                  surgical breast specimen or whether there is evidence of pathologic complete

                  response; patients who are found to be pathologically node-positive at the time

                  of surgery, based on sentinel node biopsy alone, are candidates for A011202, a

                  study developed by the Alliance in Oncology, an NCI Cooperative Group; if

                  A011202 is open at the investigator's institution, patients should be approached

                  about participating in the A011202 study



          -  Patients with pathologic staging of ypN0(i+) or ypN0(mol+) are eligible (Note:

          -  For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen or

             re-excision must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by

             the local pathologist; additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain

             clear margins; if tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s),

             the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible; (patients with margins

             positive for lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible without additional

             resection)



          -  For patients who undergo mastectomy, the margins must be histologically free of

             residual (microscopic or gross) tumor



          -  The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (including re-excision of

             margins) and randomization must be no more than 56 days; also, if adjuvant

             chemotherapy was administered, the interval between the last chemotherapy treatment

             and randomization must be no more than 56 days



          -  The patient must have recovered from surgery with the incision completely healed and

             no signs of infection



          -  If adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, chemotherapy-related toxicity that may

    <brief_summary>

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded, multi-center evaluation of the

      stroke incidence in patients implanted with a HeartWare® HVAD who receive optimal blood

      pressure management. The study compares results of stroke incidence in a new cohort of

      subjects receiving optimal blood pressure management to a reference stroke incidence

      observed in the original IDE clinical trial (HW004) that did not specify optimal blood

      pressure management. In addition, a secondary endpoint will evaluate non-inferiority of

      stroke-free success on the originally implanted device to a control group (i.e. any

      FDA-approved LVAD for destination therapy). Subjects will be randomized to HeartWare® HVAD

      or control LVAD in a 2:1 ratio. Each subject receiving the HeartWare® HVAD or control LVAD

      is followed to the primary and secondary endpoints at 12 months, with a subsequent follow-up

      period extending to 5 years post implant.

      The hypotheses of the study are as follows:



        -  Mass-based inverse optimization in radiotherapy treatment planning will result in a

           reduction of normal tissue and organs at risk (OAR) doses for desired prescription

           therapeutic doses to the targets.



        -  Dose-mass histograms (DMHs) may be more relevant to radiotherapy treatment planning and

           treatment plan assessment than the standard of care, realized through dose-volume

           histograms (DVHs)

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Cancer patients continue to represent a challenging disease population, which faces rather

      poor prognosis with current treatment planning and delivery practices. Venues for a

      potential dose escalation and/or increased healthy tissue sparing, through innovative

      therapeutic approaches for those patients, are clearly needed. Current state of the art

      radiotherapy treatment planning relies on the dose-volume-histogram (DVH) paradigm, where

      doses to fractional (most often) or absolute volumes of anatomical structures are employed

      in both optimization and plan evaluation process. It has been argued however, that the

      effects of delivered dose seem to be more closely related to healthy tissue toxicity (and

      thereby to clinical outcomes) when dose-mass-histograms (DMHs) are considered in treatment

      plan evaluation.



      The investigators propose the incorporation of mass and density information explicitly into

      the cost functions of the inverse optimization process, thereby shifting from DVH to DMH

      treatment planning paradigm. This novel DMH-based intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)

      optimization aims in minimization of radiation doses to a certain mass, rather than a

      volume, of healthy tissue. The investigators' working hypothesis is that DMH- optimization

      will reduce doses to healthy tissue substantially. In certain cases, with extensive,

      difficult to treat disease, lower doses to healthy tissue can be used for isotoxic dose

      escalation, which may result in an increase in estimated loco-regional tumor control

      probability.



      To test the study hypothesis, the investigators will pursue the following specific aims:



        -  (1) Develop the theoretical and computational framework of the DMH-based IMRT

           optimization. This framework will incorporate 3D and 4D IMRT as well as 3D volumetric

           modulated arc (VMAT) planning for different anatomical sites.



        -  (2) Investigate different parametric forms for DMH-optimization functions. The ultimate

           goal would be the simultaneous minimization of healthy tissue doses and/or escalation

           of therapeutic doses, without violating the established dosimetric tolerances for

           healthy anatomical structures.



        -  (3) Practical implementation and application of this novel optimization paradigm, where

           virtual clinical trials for cohorts of lung, head-and-neck, and prostate cancer cases

           will be performed.



      Statistical significance of the DMH-optimization dosimetric improvements over standard of

      care DVH-optimization will be quantified. Prospective 3D and 4D CT data collection will be

      used to study the interactions between tumor time-trending changes and DMH-based

      optimization results. 4D CT data will also be used to investigate and quantify the

      correlation between DMH-based end points and the loss of pulmonary function during and after

      radiotherapy treatment. The deliverability (with the existing radiotherapy treatment

      equipment) of the investigators' 3D VMAT and 3D/4D IMRT plans will be experimentally

      verified, thereby paving the road for initiation of clinical trials.

    <brief_summary>

      This trial is studying Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) for measuring muscle health. The

      trial is studying people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), other neuromuscular

      diseases, and healthy volunteers to see if the EIM device can measure disease in muscle

      tissue.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter, 9-month study evaluating the effectiveness of electrical impedance

      myography (EIM) as a diagnostic and disease-tracking tool. In addition, the following will

      be studied:



        1. Determine EIM device's ability to discriminate between ALS and "look-alike" non-fatal,

           motor-predominant syndromes;



        2. Track EIM progression over time and determine the best summary EIM measure that could

           serve as an endpoint in future clinical trials and individual patient care; and,



        3. Determine whether EIM progression is predictive of a combined outcome of survival and

           progression as measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale, Revised (ALSFRS-R), Hand-held

           Dynamometry (HHD) and Vital Capacity (VC) measures.

    <brief_summary>

      Carpal tunnel is an early manifestation of amyloidosis in a significant minority of

      patients. This specimen collection protocol will allow the investigators to screen patients

      with carpal tunnel syndrome for amyloidosis.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The investigators propose to assess a high risk population of patients, those with carpal

      tunnel syndrome, and systematically assess them for Amyloid Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and

      Transthyretin-Related Amyloidosis (ATTR) with simple laboratory blood tests. The combination

      of serum immunofixation electrophoresis together with serum free light chain (FLC) assay

      approaches 100% sensitivity for identifying the monoclonal protein underlying the illness in

      patients with AL amyloidosis. In addition to this, testing for transthyretin gene mutations

      will allow the investigators to identify patients with ATTR. The investigators believe this

      simple screening panel (serum immunofixation and serum FLC assay and transthyretin mutation

      analysis) may allow the investigators to identify patients early in the course of their

      disease, at which point the investigators can intervene with effective treatment and spare

      patients a significant amount of morbidity and mortality.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of Civacir® to prevent the

      recurrence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) after liver transplant.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Civacir® 10%, Hepatitis C Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) is a high-titer human

      polyclonal immune globulin (IgG) containing a diversity of antibodies that target and bind

      the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to prevent infection. Subjects who reduce their viral load to

      less than 100 IU/ml HCV RNA through up to 24 weeks of antiviral therapy prior to liver

      transplant are enrolled in the study. There is no requirement to reach undetectable virus

      prior to transplant as the function of Civacir® is to neutralize any remaining virus in

      circulation.



      Subjects randomized to Civacir® treatment arms receive study drug infusions starting on the

      day of liver transplant followed by 15 doses over a 10 week period to prevent the recurrence

      of quantifiable Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) after liver transplant. The study will evaluate

      dosing arms ranging from 200 mg/kg to 300 mg/kg compared to a control arm. For the primary

      endpoint, efficacy is defined as persistent viral load suppression maintaining HCV RNA

      levels below the lower limit of quantitation as determined by central laboratory Polymerase

      Chain Reaction (PCR) at 22 weeks post-liver transplant and then at 34 weeks post-liver

      transplant to demonstrate durability of effect.

    <brief_summary>

      Thirty (30) patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI

      scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization will be enrolled in the study.This is a phase

      II study intended to gain additional safety and efficacy assessments among two dose levels

      previously studied in a phase I setting. In this study, a 20 million total hMSC dose and a

      100 million total hMSC dose will be randomly allocated administered via the Biocardia

      Helical infusion system in a blinded manner.



      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed

      cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or

      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be

      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and

      able to survive in host myocardium, which is often a hostile environment of limited blood

      supply and immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that

      administered cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically

      with the surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests

      that this may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly,

      transplantation of graft cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse

      ventricular remodeling. To date, a number of candidate cells have been transplanted in

      experimental models, including fetal and neonatal cardiomyocytes5, 6, embryonic stem

      cell-derived myocytes5, 7, 8, tissue engineered contractile grafts9, skeletal myoblasts10,

      11, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow12-20, and cardiac precursors residing

      within the heart itself21-23. There has been substantial clinical development in the use of

      whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both

      post-infarction patients and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and

      heart failure. The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also

      been studied clinically24, 25.



      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent a highly promising modality

      for cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone

      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this

      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority

      of the trials.



      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is a common and problematic condition;

      definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority

      of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied

      less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.

    <brief_summary>

      The use of non-invasive methods of respiratory support to reduce complications of prolonged

      invasive mechanical ventilation in preterm infants has increased.



      The most common mode is nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIMV). In NIMV, the

      interval between mechanical breaths is fixed and is determined by the frequency dialed by

      the clinician. Asynchrony between the infant's spontaneous breathing may exist since

      mechanical breaths delivered at fixed intervals can occur at different times over the

      inspiratory or expiratory phases of the infant's spontaneous breathing. Synchronized-NIMV is

      a mode similar to NIMV where the ventilator cycle is delivered in synchrony with the

      infant's spontaneous inspiration. This has been achieved by using techniques to detect the

      infant's spontaneous inspiration.



      The advantages or disadvantages of synchronized compared to non-synchronized NIMV remain to

      be determined.



      This study seeks to evaluate the effect of synchronized NIMV versus non-synchronized NIMV on

      ventilation and gas exchange in premature infants who require supplemental oxygen.



      The hypothesis is that the use of flow synchronized nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation

      (S-NIMV) in comparison to non-synchronized NIMV will improve ventilation and gas exchange

      and reduce breathing effort.



      The objective of the study is to compare the effect of flow synchronized-NIMV to

      non-synchronized-NIMV on tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (VE), gas exchange, breathing

      effort, apnea and chest wall distortion in preterm neonates with lung disease.

    <brief_summary>

      HEP is a five-year, prospective, observational study whose primary goal is to identify

      clinical characteristics and biomarkers predictive of disease outcome, progression, and

      treatment response in participants with newly treated focal epilepsy.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Epilepsy is a serious disease. It affects approximately 2.4 million Americans, with a

      lifetime risk estimated at 3%. More than 181,000 Americans develop epilepsy every year, and

      a substantial proportion has seizures that cannot be controlled by available medications.

      For the vast majority of patients with epilepsy, we do not understand the biological basis

      of their disease; we do not know whether a given anti-epileptic drug (AED) will be

      effective; and we cannot predict the severity of the seizure disorder, the potential

      emergence of co-morbidities, or the likelihood of remission.



      The Human Epilepsy Project seeks to answer these unknowns by collecting high-resolution

      clinical information and treatment response, MRIs, EEGs, and blood and urine samples for

      biomarkers. A major outcome of the project is to create an open data repository of clinical

      information and biologic samples for future studies.



      HEP may have a transformative impact on epilepsy diagnosis and treatment by identifying

      critical clinical features and biomarkers at the onset of epilepsy that can be used to

      predict outcome and guide therapy. We hope to identify subsets of patients at high risk for

      pharmacoresistance who may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy and earlier

      consideration for surgical treatment. The existence of biomarkers that predict the

      likelihood of disease remission would dramatically affect treatment decisions and counseling

      for millions of patients.



      In addition to its impact on current clinical care, the data and specimens collected in HEP,

      including sequential neuroimaging, electrophysiology and metabolite profiles, and banked DNA

      for the purpose of future genomics studies, have the potential to provide new insights into

      the biological basis of focal epilepsy, which will advance our efforts to discover effective

      treatments and cures for this disorder.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II trial studies how well transoral surgery followed by low-dose or

      standard-dose radiation therapy works in treating patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)

      positive stage III-IVA oropharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to

      kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of

      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation

      therapy with chemotherapy may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet

      known how much extra treatment needs to be given after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Accrual, risk distribution, and surgical quality will be used to determine the

      feasibility of a prospective multi-institutional study of transoral surgery for HPV positive

      (+) oropharynx cancer followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy.



      II. To assess the oncologic efficacy following transoral resection and adjuvant therapy in

      patients determined to be at "intermediate risk" after surgical excision, the 2-year

      progression free survival (PFS) rate will be examined.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate the patient distribution with various histologic risk features. II. To assess

      and compare early and late toxicities associated with transoral surgery (TOS) and the

      different doses of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (PORT).



      III. To evaluate swallowing function before and after TOS and risk-adjusted adjuvant

      therapy.



      IV. To evaluate quality of life (QOL), swallowing perception and performance, voice

      outcomes, and head and neck symptoms.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To correlate tumor TP53 mutation and other associated mutation profile with pathologic

      findings, with PFS and other outcome parameters in patients with resectable HPV-associated

      oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) after the above treatments.



      II. To evaluate radiation resistance markers, including excision repair cross complementing

      1 (ERCC1) single nucleotide polymorphism and protein expression, and correlate them with

      treatment efficacy.



      III. To investigate the usefulness of biomarkers in predicting progression-free survival and

      biomarkers, including tumor ERCC1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), plasma

      cytokine/chemokines, cellular immunity to HPV, and oral HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).



      OUTLINE: Patients are classified by risk status (low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk)

      and assigned to the appropriate treatment group. Patients classified as intermediate risk

      are randomized to 1 or 2 treatment arms.



      ARM A (low risk): Patients undergo transoral surgical resection of the oropharyngeal tumor.



      ARM B (intermediate risk): Patients undergo transoral surgical resection of the

      oropharyngeal tumor. Patients then undergo low-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy

      (IMRT) once daily (QD) five days a week for 5 weeks.



      ARM C (intermediate risk): Patients undergo transoral surgical resection of the

      oropharyngeal tumor. Patients then undergo standard-dose IMRT QD five days a week for 6

      weeks.



      ARM D (high risk): Patients undergo transoral surgical resection of the oropharyngeal tumor.

      Patients then undergo standard-dose IMRT QD five days a week for 6-7 weeks. Patients also

      receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on

      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 during radiation therapy.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and

      then every 6 months for 1 year.

    <brief_summary>

      The main purpose of this study is to see whether CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin, an

      antibody-drug conjugate) is effective in treating patients who have advanced Triple-Negative

      Breast Cancer (TNBC), and whose tumor cells make a protein called glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB),

      which CDX-011 binds to. The study will also further characterize the safety of CDX-011

      treatment in this patient population.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      CDX-011 consists of an antibody attached to a drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), that can

      kill cancer cells. The antibody delivers the drug to cancer cells by attaching to a protein

      called glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB) that is expressed on the cancer cell. The MMAE is then

      released inside of the cell, where it interferes with cell growth and may lead to cell

      death.



      This study will examine the efficacy and safety of CDX-011 in patients with advanced TNBC

      that makes the gpNMB protein. The effect of CDX-011 will be compared to treatment with

      capecitabine.



      Eligible patients who enroll in the study will be randomly assigned (by chance) to receive

      treatment with CDX-011 or with capecitabine. For every three patients enrolled, two will

      receive CDX-011 and one will receive treatment with capecitabine. All patients enrolled in

      the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is responding to treatment

      and for any side effects that may occur.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study

      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of ibudilast administered twice

      daily over a 96 week period in subjects with primary or secondary progressive multiple

      sclerosis who are currently untreated with long-term MS disease modifying therapy (DMT) or

      who are receiving either glatiramer acetate (GA) or interferon beta (IFNβ-1a [Avonex, Rebif]

      or IFNβ-1b [Betaseron Etavia]) treatment. Study drug will be administered as an adjunct to

      glatiramer or beta interferon treatment. A total of 250 male and female subjects from 21 to

      65 years old, inclusive, are planned to be enrolled into two treatment groups. Randomization

      of subjects will be stratified by disease status (primary progressive multiple sclerosis or

      secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and immunomodulating therapy status: current use

      of immunomodulating therapy or no current use of immunomodulating therapy.



      The study will consist of a screening phase (up to 30 days) followed by a treatment phase

      (96 weeks) and a follow-up visit (1 month post Week 96 visit). Following the screening

      phase, subjects who continue to meet entry criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2

      treatment groups: doses up to ibudilast 100 mg/day or matching-placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Study

      drug will be administered twice daily (BID), e.g., ibudilast 50 mg or placebo taken in the

      morning and evening).

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to identify individuals with achromatopsia caused by mutations

      in the CNGB3 gene and characterize their clinical condition using several tests of visual

      function every 6 months for up to 1.5 years.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of achromatopsia will be asked to provide informed

      consent and will then have a single 5 mL blood sample drawn for DNA sequence analysis of

      genes known to cause achromatopsia, including the CNGB3 gene. All participants will be

      informed of the results of testing for these mutations. Those with mutations in both alleles

      of the CNGB3 gene will be evaluated every 6 months for up to 1.5 years by using a variety of

      non-invasive visual function tests to more fully characterize their clinical condition. This

      testing will include routine ophthalmic examination and tests of visual acuity, color

      vision, reading speed, perimetry, nystagmus, light sensitivity, optical coherence

      tomography, adaptive optics retinal imaging, electroretinography, fundus photography and

      completion of a quality of life questionnaire.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II trial studies how well whole-brain radiation therapy or

      stereotactic radiosurgery with or without lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients

      with breast cancer that has too many of a protein called human epidermal growth factor

      receptor 2 (HER2) on its cells and has spread to the brain. Radiation therapy uses high

      energy x rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a

      specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the

      tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Lapatinib

      ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for

      cell growth. It is not yet known whether whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic

      radiosurgery together with lapatinib ditosylate is an effective treatment for brain

      metastasis from breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine if there is a signal for an increase in complete response (CR) rate in the

      measurable brain metastases at 12 weeks post radiation therapy (RT) (whole brain or

      stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) as determined by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scan of

      the brain, with the addition of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) to WBRT/SRS compared to

      WBRT/SRS alone.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate CR rate of the measurable brain metastases at 4 weeks post RT (WBRT/SRS) as

      determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to

      WBRT/SRS alone.



      II. To evaluate objective response rate of measurable brain metastases at 4 and 12 weeks

      post RT (WBRT/SRS) as determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to

      WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.



      III. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific objective response rate (CR + partial response

      [PR]) at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS.



      IV. To evaluate central nervous system (CNS) progressive disease outside the targeted

      measurable disease with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.



      V. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific progression at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS.



      VI. To evaluate treatment related adverse events when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared

      to WBRT/SRS alone.



      VII. To evaluate overall CNS complete response: disappearance of all CNS target lesions

      sustained for at least 4 weeks; with no new lesions, no use of corticosteroids, and patient

      is stable or improved clinically, when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS

      alone.



      VIII. To evaluate overall CNS progressive disease (within or outside targeted measurable

      disease) with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.



      IX. To evaluate overall survival when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS

      alone.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks for a total of 15 treatments or SRS

      for 1 treatment.



      ARM B: Patients undergo WBRT or SRS as in Arm A. Patients also receive lapatinib ditosylate

      orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then

      every 12 weeks thereafter.

    <brief_summary>

      Sunshine Heart is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center, randomized trial to assess the

      safety and efficacy of the C-Pulse® System ("C-Pulse").



      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the use of the C-Pulse as a treatment for

      patients in moderate to severe heart failure (HF) has demonstrated safety and efficacy, such

      that the C-Pulse System merits Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market the

      device in the United States.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The C-Pulse® System is indicated for use in patients with moderate to severe heart failure

      while on optimal heart failure drug and on device therapies. The C-Pulse® System is intended

      to relieve the symptoms of heart failure, improve quality of life and cardiac function, and

      reduce the need for heart failure hospitalization. It is intended for use in hospital and at

      home. It is not intended as a replacement for heart function; it is not life sustaining or

      life-supporting therapy. It does not preclude the use of other heart failure therapies, such

      as valve surgery, heart transplantation or LVAD.



      The Sunshine Heart C-Pulse System is an implantable, non-blood contacting, non-obligatory,

      heart assist device. The system provides cardiac assistance through an extra-aortic balloon

      Cuff and ECG sense lead connected by means of a Percutaneous Interface Lead (PIL) to an

      external pneumatic Driver. The PIL is held secure externally, at the exit site, with a

      simple adhesive clip (C-Patch or similar) for immobilization of the external part of the

      PIL. The Driver is adjusted using a dedicated notebook computer (Programmer) with

      specialized software.



      The non-blood contacting feature of the C-Pulse® System also allows the device to be

      intermittently turned off as tolerated. This allows the patient freedom for personal

      hygiene.

        Inclusion Criteria:



          1. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% (by transthoracic ECHO within 90 days

             prior to randomization)



          2. ACC/AHA Stage C and NYHA III to ambulatory Class IV



          3. Age ≥ 18 years



          4. Must have cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) when clinically indicated,

             implanted ≥90 days prior to randomization.



          5. Must have an implanted cardio-defibrillator (ICD) when clinically indicated,

             implanted at least 30 days prior to randomization.



             Note: If a subject is clinically indicated for an ICD but refuses the ICD, he/she may

             be enrolled. Please document the refusal of the ICD in the medical record and the

             eCRFs.



          6. Patient must be on stable, up-titrated medical therapy as recommended according to

             current guidelines (Circulation. 2009; 119 (12): 1977-2016) which minimally includes:



               -  ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I) at stable doses for 1 month prior to enrollment, if

                  tolerated, AND



               -  a beta blocker (carvedilol, sustained release metoprolol succinate, or

                  bisoprolol) for 3 months prior to enrollment, if tolerated, with a stable

                  up-titrated dose for 1 month prior to enrollment.



               -  This also includes an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) at stable doses for

                  1 month prior to enrollment, if tolerated, when ACE-I is not tolerated.



               -  Stable is defined as no more than a 100% increase or a 50% decrease in dose. If

                  the patient is intolerant to ACE-I, ARB, or beta blockers, documented evidence

                  must be available.



               -  In those intolerant to both ACE-I and ARB, combination therapy with hydralazine

                  and oral nitrate should be considered. Therapeutic equivalence for ACE-I

                  substitutions is allowed within the enrollment stability timelines.



               -  Aldosterone inhibitor therapy should be added. Eplerenone requires dosage

                  stability for 1 month prior to enrollment.



               -  Diuretics may be used as necessary to keep the patient euvolemic.



          7. Functional limitation due to heart failure as defined by a 6 Minute Walk test of ≥

             175 ≤ 375 meters, measured within 30 days prior to randomization



          8. At least one hospitalization for decompensated heart failure as defined below, while

             on heart failure medications, within 12 months prior to randomization or BNP level &gt;

             300 or NTproBNP &gt; 1500



             Heart failure related hospitalization is defined by the following:



               -  signs and symptoms of worsening heart failure; and



               -  treatment with intravenous heart failure therapy (including but not limited to

                  diuretic or inotropic therapy) and



               -  a minimum of one date change in the hospital

      RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer

      and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x

      rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells

      that remain after surgery.



      PURPOSE: This phase II trial studies how well breast-conserving surgery and radiation

      therapy work in treating patients with multiple ipsilateral breast cancer

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OBJECTIVES:



      Primary



        -  To assess the local recurrence (LR) rate with breast-conservation in patients with

           multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).



      Secondary



        -  To examine the conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins;

           poor cosmesis within the first year of attempting breast-conservation surgery (BCS) or

           inability to satisfy the radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy bed

           of each site of disease.



        -  To assess whether patients who did not undergo re-excision for close margins (&lt; 2 mm)

           have a higher local recurrence (LR) rate than patients for whom negative margins were

           achieved.



        -  To assess patient's perception of cosmesis and incidence of breast lymphedema.



        -  To assess incidence of breast lymphedema



        -  To examine the type and severity of adverse effects of breast conserving surgery and

           radiation for women with multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).



        -  To examine the radiation-related side effects of whole-breast radiation with a boost to

           1 large or &gt; 1 lumpectomy site.



      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.



      Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with all lesions resected to negative

      margins using 1 lumpectomy or 2-3 separate lumpectomy incisions at the discretion of the

      surgeon. Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy at the discretion

      of the treating medical oncologist based on tumor characteristics.

      (hMSCs) in patients with bronchiectasis receiving standard of care therapy, and to explore

      treatment efficacy

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      A Phase 1 investigation will be performed to test the safety of two doses of bone-marrow

      derived hMSCs (20,000,000 and 100,000,000) administered via peripheral intravenous infusion.



      Group 1: 3 subjects will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 20 x106 (20

      million) cells delivered via peripheral intravenous infusion Group 2: 3 subjects will

      receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs: 1 x108 (100 million) cells delivered

      via peripheral intravenous infusion Interim safety analysis will be performed four weeks

      after the 1st subject is enrolled in each cohort. Continued safety and tolerability with

      review of adverse events (AEs) will be assessed at each visit. Efficacy parameters

      (pulmonary function tests, lung diffusion capacity, lung volumes, 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT),

      and dyspnea/Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaires) will be assessed every 12 weeks until

      study completion. Clinical laboratory tests to assess safety will be performed at every

      visit.



      High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan will be performed at the baseline visit (if

      not done within three months prior to enrollment) and then at week 24.

      This study is to assess the effect of tirasemtiv versus placebo on respiratory function in

      patients with ALS.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      CY 4031 is a multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, stratified,

      parallel group study in patients with ALS with the selective fast skeletal muscle troponin

      activator, tirasemtiv. The study includes three phases; an open-label phase (2 weeks), a

      double-blind, placebo-controlled phase (48 weeks), and a double-blind, placebo-controlled

      tirasemtiv withdrawal phase (4 weeks). Patients who can complete two weeks of treatment with

      open-label tirasemtiv (125 mg twice daily) will be randomized 3:2:2:2 to placebo and three

      different dose levels of tirasemtiv. Approximately 600 patients will be enrolled onto

      open-label treatment. Patients who enter the study on riluzole 50 mg twice daily will

      continue on riluzole but at a reduced dose of 50 mg once daily.

    <brief_summary>

      This will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled

      phase II trial of trastuzumab + nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF versus trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone. Our

      target study population is high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer patients. High-risk

      HER2-positive breast cancer patients are defined as:



      Those with HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of hormone receptor status, who receive

      neoadjuvant therapy with an approved regimen that includes trastuzumab and at least four

      cycles (12 weeks) of taxane-containing chemotherapy, and fail to achieve a pCR.



      Those with HER2-positive breast cancer, regardless of hormone receptor status, who undergo

      surgery as a first intervention and are found to have ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes.



      Those with HER2-positive, hormone receptor negative breast cancer who undergo surgery as a

      first intervention and are found to have 1-3 positive lymph nodes.



      Disease-free subjects after standard of care multi-modality therapy will be screened and

      HLA-typed.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      In this study, the investigators intend to assess the ability of the combination of

      trastuzumab and the HER2 vaccine nelipepimut-S (administered with the immunoadjuvant GM-CSF)

      given in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrences in patients with high-risk

      HER2-positive breast cancer. High-risk is defined as those patients that do not achieve a

      pCR after neoadjuvant therapy with an approved regimen that includes trastuzumab and at

      least four cycles (12 weeks) of taxane-containing chemotherapy or those who undergo upfront

      surgery and are found to have greater than or equal to four positive lymph nodes regardless

      of hormone receptor status or 1-3 positive lymph nodes and are hormone receptor negative.



      Following surgery, patients will be screened and HLA-typed (consent #1). Nelipepimut-S is a

      CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine that is restricted to HLA-2+ or HLA-A3+ patients

      (approximately two-thirds of the US population). HLA-A2+ and/or A3+ patients who meet all

      other eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive trastuzumab + nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF

      or trastuzumab + GM-CSF alone (consent #2). The trastuzumab will be administered to all

      patients consistent with current standard of care. Patients randomized to the

      nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF arm will receive vaccinations of nelipepimut-S (1000 mcg) and GM-CSF

      (250 mcg) administered intradermally every three weeks for six total vaccinations, 30-120

      minutes after completion of trastuzumab infusion. The first vaccination will be given with

      the third dose of maintenance trastuzumab administered as monotherapy. Patients randomized

      to the GM-CSF alone arm will receive inoculations of GM-CSF (250 mcg) administered in an

      identical manner to those receiving nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF. Patients will be blinded as to

      whether they are receiving nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF or GM-CSF alone.



      Upon completion of the primary vaccination/inoculation series, booster inoculations (same

      dose and route) will be administered every six months x 4. The first booster inoculation

      will occur 12 months ± 2 weeks after the initiation of trastuzumab maintenance therapy, with

      subsequent boosters timed every six months + 2 weeks. Boosters will therefore occur at the

      following timepoints after initiation of trastuzumab maintenance therapy: 12 months ± 2

      weeks, 18 months ± 2 weeks, 24 months ± 2 weeks and 30 months ± 2 weeks. Booster

      inoculations will occur for patients randomized to receive nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF as well as

      patients randomized to receive GM-CSF alone, and will consist of the same treatment drugs

      and dosing (i.e. nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF patients will be boosted with nelipepimut-S/GM-CSF

      while GM-CSF alone patients will be boosted with GM-CSF alone). Patient blinding will be

      maintained throughout the study.



      Subjects will be followed for safety issues, immunologic response and clinical recurrence.

      Patients will be monitored 48-72 hours after each inoculation for reaction to the

      inoculation as well as documentation of any adverse effects experienced. Immunologic

      response will be monitored primarily by in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)

      reactions but also may be documented by other immunologic assays. All patients will be

      followed for a total of 36 months from the time of initiation of trastuzumab maintenance

      therapy to document disease-free status.

      The study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blinded,

      placebo-controlled Phase II trial of Herceptin + NeuVax(TM) vaccine (E75 peptide/granulocyte

      macrophage-colony stimulating factor) (GM-CSF) versus Herceptin + GM-CSF alone. The target

      study population is node-positive (NP) (or node-negative [NN] if negative for both ER and

      PR) breast cancer patients with HER2 1+ and 2+ expressing tumors who are disease-free after

      standard of care therapy. Disease-free subjects after standard of care multi-modality

      therapy will be screened and HLA-typed. E75 is a CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine that is

      restricted to HLA-A2+ or HLA-A3+ patients (approximately two-thirds of the US population).

    <detailed_description>

      In this study, the investigators intend to assess the ability of the combination of

      Herceptin and NeuVax vaccine (HER2 protein E75 peptide administered with the immunoadjuvant

      GM-CSF) given in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrences in NP (or NN if negative for

      both estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors) breast cancer patients with tumors that

      express low (1+) or intermediate (2+) levels of HER2. Enrolled patients will be randomized

      to receive Herceptin and NeuVax vaccine or Herceptin with GM-CSF alone (no NeuVax vaccine).

      The safety of the combination therapy will be documented, specifically to ensure that no

      additive cardiac toxicity results from combination HER2-directed therapy. Efficacy will be

      documented by comparing the DFS and immunological responses between treatment groups.



      The primary efficacy endpoint is to compare DFS at 24 months between treatment groups. The

      primary safety issue is to prove there is no additive cardiac toxicity with combination

      HER2-directed therapy. A secondary endpoint of the trial is to compare DFS at 36 months.

      Immunologic responses to the vaccine will also be documented and correlated to clinical

      benefit.



      The study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blinded,

      placebo-controlled Phase II trial of Herceptin + NeuVax vaccine versus Herceptin + GM-CSF

      alone. The target study population is NP (or NN if negative for both ER and PR) breast

      cancer patients with HER2 1+ and 2+ expressing tumors who are disease-free after standard of

      care therapy. Disease-free subjects after standard of care multi-modality therapy will be

      screened and HLA-typed. E75 is a CD8-eliciting peptide vaccine that is restricted to HLA-A2+

      or HLA-A3+ patients (approximately two-thirds of the US population).



      HLA-A2+/A3+ patients who meet all other eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive

      Herceptin + NeuVax vaccine or Herceptin + GM-CSF alone. For both groups, Herceptin will be

      given every three weeks as monotherapy for one year, to be given upon completion of standard

      of care chemotherapy/radiotherapy. The first Herceptin infusion must be given no sooner than

      three weeks and no later than 12 weeks after completion of chemotherapy/radiotherapy.

      Herceptin will be dosed at the recommended initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg and at

      recommended maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg q3wk. Herceptin will be administered as described

      in Section 4.3. Patients randomized to the NeuVax vaccine arm will receive vaccinations of

      E75 peptide (1000 mcg) and GM-CSF (250 mcg) administered intradermally every three weeks for

      six total vaccinations, 30-120 minutes after completion of Herceptin infusion. The NeuVax

      vaccine series will begin immediately after completion of the third Herceptin infusion. In

      extenuating circumstances, the first vaccination may be delayed to the fourth or fifth

      Herceptin infusion with prior approval from the Principal Investigator. Those patients

      randomized to the GM-CSF alone arm will receive vaccinations of GM-CSF (250 mcg)

      administered in an identical manner to those receiving NeuVax vaccine. Patients will be

      blinded as to whether they are receiving NeuVax vaccine or GM-CSF alone.



      Upon completion of the vaccination series, booster inoculations (same dose and route) will

      be administered every six months x4 for total combination (Herceptin and vaccine) treatment

      duration of 30 months. The first booster inoculation will occur with the final Herceptin

      infusion, with subsequent boosters timed every six months from the first booster. Booster

      inoculations will occur for patients randomized to receive E75/GM-CSF as well as patients

      randomized to receive GM-CSF alone, and will consist of the same treatment drugs and dosing

      (i.e. E75/GM-CSF patients will be boosted with E75/GM-CSF while GM-CSF alone patients will

      be boosted with GM-CSF alone). Patient blinding will be maintained throughout the study.



      Subjects will be followed for safety issues, immunologic response and clinical recurrence.

      Patients will be monitored 48-72 hours after each inoculation for reaction to the

      inoculation as well as documentation of any adverse effects experienced. Immunologic

      response will be documented with both in vitro phenotypic and functional assays as well as

      in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. All patients will be followed for a

      total of 36 months to document disease-free status.



      The investigators plan to enroll 300 patients (150 in each treatment arm) at a planned

      accrual rate of 12 patients per month (approximately one per study site per month). With

      accrual beginning in January 2012, enrollment of the last patient would be expected in

      January 2014 followed by a three-year follow-up period. The duration of the trial is

      expected to be five years.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a phase 1a/1b, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, dose escalation study to

      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor

      activity of ACY-241 for oral administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy with

      orally administered pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone in eligible patients with

      relapsed or relapsed-and-refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      During phase 1a, patients will receive 1 cycle of ACY-241 monotherapy. Patients who complete

      the ACY-241 monotherapy cycle without a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and are clinically

      stable may continue to phase 1b combination therapy, beginning with Cycle 2. During phase

      1b, patients will receive ACY 241 in combination with pomalidomide and low dose

      dexamethasone at the currently approved pomalidomide dose and schedule. Each cohort of

      patients in phase 1a and phase 1b will consist of at least 3 patients. The first patient

      enrolled in each cohort of phase 1a will be observed for 1 week before enrollment of

      subsequent patients in the cohort. Patients who withdraw consent before entering phase 1b

      will be replaced. (Replacement patients must complete phase 1a prior to continuing to phase

      1b.) Patients who experience a DLT or other unacceptable toxicity in Cycle 1 of phase 1a

      monotherapy or Cycle 2, the first cycle of phase 1b combination therapy, will be removed

      from study treatment. An assessment of the safety of treatment will be completed by the

      Safety Review Committee (SRC) prior to dose-escalation.

    <brief_summary>

      This study is intended to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of a drug, OXi4503

      (combretastatin A1 diphosphate, CA1P, OXiGENE), in patients with relapsed and refractory AML

      and MDS.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Despite initial disease remissions with cytotoxic chemotherapies, patients with AML and MDS

      often relapse and die of their disease. Novel strategies for targeting dependent pathways

      are needed. AML and MDS depend on blood vessels for survival and proliferation. OXi4503 is a

      novel microtubule targeting agent that selectively destroys cancer-associated blood vessels,

      induces cancer cell apoptosis via an ortho-quinone moiety and results in significant

      regressions of solid tumors. OXi4503 is currently being tested in phase I clinical trials of

      advanced solid tumors. In preclinical studies with human AML, OXi4503 was cytotoxic to

      leukemia cells, decreased size of chloromas, regressed leukemic cell engraftment in bone

      marrow and brought about phenotypic and molecular remissions. Given these results, we

      hypothesize that OXi4503 has disease remitting effects in myeloid malignancies such as AML

      and MDS. Before evaluating efficacy, safety and maximum tolerated dose of OXi4503 will be

      defined in AML and MDS patients. In addition, assessments of pharmacokinetic (PK) and

      pharmacokinetic (PD) parameters will be made, and relationships between dose and biologic

      activity will be defined. Results from this trial will provide new clinical data and

      biologic insight regarding the effects of OXi4503 in AML and MDS, and will serve as the

      basis for future efficacy trials.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ticagrelor is effective in reducing the

      number of days of pain, intensity of pain, and reducing the use of analgesics due to sickle

      cell disease

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, study

      evaluating 2 doses of ticagrelor in 90 patients aged 18 to 30 years, with sickle cell

      disease (SCD). Patients will be randomised to double-blind double-dummy treatment period in

      a 1:1:1 ratio (30 to each treatment group) to receive ticagrelor 10 mg twice daily (bid), or

      ticagrelor 45 mg bid, or placebo bid to determine the frequency of days with pain using an

      electronic diary (eDiary) every day. Approximately 180 patients will be enrolled. Patient

      will be followed for safety assessment during and after 2 weeks of treatment completion.



      During the 16 week treatment period, patients will complete a daily eDiary concerning daily

      pain intensity, pain location, use of analgesics and absence from school or work. At the end

      of the study patients will be asked to rate the change in their sickle cell pain compared to

      the start of treatment. Platelet aggregation will be measured and reported as P2Y12 reaction

      units (PRU) pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose at week 4 and week 5 after treatment start.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be measured at 2 hours post-dose at week 4, and

      pre-dose and at 2 hours post-dose at week 5. Biomarkers will be assessed pre-dose at week 4,

      week 5 and week 8. During the study, patients will be evaluated for adverse events (AEs)

      including bleeding and vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).

    <brief_summary>

      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 2/3 study of Toca 511 and Toca FC versus

      standard of care that comprises Investigator's choice of single agent chemotherapy

      (lomustine or temozolomide) or bevacizumab administered to subjects undergoing resection for

      first or second recurrence (including this recurrence) of GBM or AA. Subjects meeting all of

      the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized prior to surgery in a

      1:1 ratio to receive either Toca 511 and Toca FC (Experimental arm, Arm T) or control

      treatment with one option of standard of care (Arm SOC). Due to the prognostic influence of

      molecular subgroups such as isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation, the trial will be stratified

      based on this determination from the primary pathology or subsequent biopsy known locally or

      otherwise determined centrally. A second stratification factor is based on the patient's

      Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) (70-80 vs 90-100). Further, to account for potential

      differences in treatment choices for the control arm in regions, the trial will be

      stratified by geographical region during the randomization process. The study will be

      conducted in 2 parts; enrollment in the phase 3 will begin after phase 2 results are

      available.

      This first time in human study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who

      have advanced lung cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it

      is a study for subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*0201 and/or HLA-A*0206

      protein and a tumor test positive for MAGE A10 expression (protein or gene). The study will

      take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send

      them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the

      subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and

      destroying cancer cells.



      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back

      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the

      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in

      subjects with lung cancer. The study will evaluate three different cell dose levels in order

      to find out the target cell dose. Once the target cell dose is determined, additional

      subjects will be enrolled to further test the safety and effects at this cell dose.



      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells

      back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the

      subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years

      after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the

      subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the

      blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years,

      then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.

    <detailed_description>

      This is first time in human study is a single-arm study of genetically engineered MAGE

      A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells in HLA-A*0201 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb

      or V) NSCLC. Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health,

      performance status and disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility

      will undergo a large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous

      MAGE A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶TCR bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will

      receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 1800mg/ m² on Days -7 &amp; -6.



      This trial is a dose escalation trial that will evaluate 3 doses of transduced cells using a

      3+3 dose escalation design. The doses for each cell dose group are as follows.



      Group 1: 0.1 x10⁹ (+/- 20%) transduced cells. Group 2: 1 x10⁹ (+/- 20%) transduced cells.

      Group 3: 5 x10⁹ (range 1-6 x10⁹) transduced cells.



      There will be a 21-day staggering of treatment in between treating subjects in Group 1 and a

      7-day stagger between treating subjects in Groups 2 and 3.



      A DLT is defined as any clinical toxicity of Grade 3 or higher (using NCI CTC version 4.03)

      regardless of investigator's assessment of relationship to the gene-modified T-cell

      infusion. If there are no DLTs in any of the first 3 subjects enrolled in Groups 1 and 2,

      then enrolment can proceed into the next higher dose (Groups 2 and 3). If one subject

      develops a DLT at a specific cell dose, then an additional three subjects will be enrolled

      into that same dose group. A DLT in more than 1 out of 6 subjects within a given group will

      trigger a pause in enrolment and an overall assessment of the safety data observed to date.

      The cell dose in Group 3 will be the highest cell dose studied even if no DLTs are observed.

      The sample size of the target cell dose may be expanded up to 20 subjects to characterize

      safety and any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity.



      Subjects will visit the clinic for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion

      (Day 0) through Day 4, Days 7, 9, and 11, and then weekly until Week 4 and then at 8 weeks,

      12 weeks, 16 weeks, and every 2 months until progression of their disease (or withdrawal of

      consent for the interventional portion of the study).



      Subjects who have progressive disease following response to the initial infusion but whose

      tumors continue to express the appropriate antigen target will be eligible for a second

      infusion with engineered T-cells.



      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will

      enter a long-term follow-up study for observation of delayed adverse events. During the

      first 5 years post T-cell infusion, subjects will be seen in the clinic every 6 months for a

      physical examination and blood tests. After 5 years, the subjects will be followed up

      annually for up to 15 years.

      This study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have advanced lung

      cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. In particular, it is a study for

      subjects who have a blood test positive for HLA-A*0201, HLA-A*205 and/or HLA-A*0206 protein

      and a tumor test positive for NY-ESO-1 expression (protein or gene). The study will take the

      subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the blood, and send them to a

      laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study will be the subject's own

      T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of attacking and destroying cancer

      cells.



      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back

      to the subject through an intravenous infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the

      safety of genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in

      subjects with lung cancer.



      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician right after receiving their T cells

      back. Subjects will then be entered into a long-term follow up in order to monitor the

      subject. Subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5 years

      after the T cell infusion. If the T cells are found in the blood at five years, then the

      subjects will continue to be seen once a year until the T cells are no longer found in the

      blood for a maximum of 15 years. If the T cells are no longer found in the blood at 5 years,

      then the subject will be contacted by the Study Physician for the next 10 years.

    <detailed_description>

      This is a single-arm study of genetically engineered NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells in HLA-A*0201,

      HLA-A*0205 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subjects with advanced (Stage IIIb or V) NSCLC.

      Subjects with measurable disease will be screened for general health, performance status and

      disease stage. Following screening, subjects meeting all eligibility will undergo a

      large-volume leukapheresis to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹

      TCR bearing T cells. When the NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will receive

      cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 1800mg/ m² on Days -7 &amp; -6 followed by

      infusion of a target dose of 5x10⁹ NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹ transduced T cells (+/- 20%).



      Subjects will visit the clinic for safety and efficacy assessment daily from T cell infusion

      (Day 0) through Day 4, at Day 7, and then weekly until Week 4 and then at 8 weeks, 12 weeks,

      16 weeks, and every 2 months until progression of their disease (or withdrawal of consent

      for the interventional portion of the study).



      Subjects who have progressive disease following response to the initial infusion but whose

      tumors continue to express the appropriate antigen target will be eligible for a second

      infusion with engineered T-cells.



      All subjects, completing or withdrawing from the interventional portion of the study, will

      enter a long-term follow-up study for observation of delayed adverse events. During the

      first 5 years post T-cell infusion, subjects will be seen in the clinic every 6 months for a

      physical examination and blood tests. After 5 years, the subjects will be followed up

      annually for up to 15 years.

    <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the

      feasibility, safety, and effect of Combo, MSCs alone, and CSCs alone compared with placebo

      as well as each other in subjects with heart failure of ischemic etiology. Following a

      successful lead-in phase, a total of one hundred forty-four (144) subjects will be

      randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive Combo, MSCs, CSCs, or placebo. After randomization, baseline

      imaging, harvest procedures, and study product injection, subjects will be followed up at 1

      day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post study product injection. All

      subjects will undergo bone marrow aspiration, endomyocardial biopsy, cardiac

      catheterization, and study product injection using the NOGA® XP Mapping and Navigation

      System. Subjects will have delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DEMRI) scans to

      assess scar size and LV function and structure at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post study

      product administration. All endpoints will be assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which

      will occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days respectively from the day of study product

      injection (Day 0). For the purpose of the endpoint analysis and safety evaluations, the

      Investigators will utilize an "intention-to-treat" study population.

    <brief_summary>

      This phase II trial studies how well vismodegib and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor

      GSK2256098 work in treating patients with meningiomas that may have gotten bigger or grew

      back after treatment. Vismodegib and FAK inhibitor GSK2256098 may stop the growth of tumor

      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Each arm is a prospective, one-stage phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy of smoothened

      receptor SMO or FAK inhibitors in patients with SMO-mutated or neurofibromin 2 (NF2)-mutated

      meningiomas, respectively. There will be a separate phase 2 arm for each of the two tumor

      mutation groups and each tumor grade cohort. Patients with recurrent or progressive Grade

      I-III meningiomas will be eligible for this trial. Samples will undergo central pathology

      review. Patient's tumor samples will be tested for the presence of SMO or NF2 mutations.

      Patients harboring SMO or NF2 mutations and who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled.

      Within each arm, there will be two different patient cohorts based on histology: grade I

      versus II/III meningiomas.



      The primary and secondary objectives are described below.



      Primary objectives:



        1. To determine the activity of a SMO inhibitor in patients with meningiomas harboring SMO

           mutations as measured by 6-month progression free survival (PFS) and response rate.



        2. To determine the activity of a FAK inhibitor in patients with meningiomas harboring NF2

           mutations as measured by 6-month PFS and response rate.



      Secondary objectives:



        1. To determine overall survival and progression-free survival of SMO and FAK inhibitors

           in patients with meningioma.



        2. To determine adverse event rates of SMO and FAK inhibitors in patients with meningioma.



      NOTE: Afuresertib, the agent identified for patients with AKT1 mutation is not currently

      available. Testing for the AKT1 mutation will commence once afuresertib becomes available

      and sites are notified via a protocol amendment. Tumor samples will only be tested for SMO

      and NF2 mutations until further notice.



      Patients will be followed for 2 years after completion of treatment.

    <brief_summary>

      This screening study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have

      advanced solid or hematologic malignancy. The study will assess a subject's tumor antigen

      expression profile and HLA subtype. Based on the results, it will be determined if a subject

      can then enroll into an Adaptimmune-sponsored clinical trial which will test the safety of

      genetically changed T cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with

      solid or hematologic malignancies. No treatment intervention will occur as part of this

      screening study.



      Upon enrollment, subjects will provide a blood sample for testing. The blood sample will be

      sent to a central laboratory and tested for HLA subtype. If the results of the analysis

      match the HLA-A and/or HLA-B subtypes noted in the inclusion criteria, the subject will be

      required to provide either an archival tumor specimen or fresh tumor tissue biopsy. The

      tumor sample will be screened at a central laboratory to test for tumor biomarkers (protein

      or RNA), which may include, but are not limited to NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a, MAGE-A10, and

      others to be determined.



      Following screening for eligibility into a clinical trial(s), tumor samples will be kept by

      Adaptimmune for the purpose of developing and validating a diagnostic assay(s) for antigen

      expression profiling.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This multicenter screening study will be conducted in order to determine a subject's tumor

      antigen expression profile and HLA subtype, and subsequent eligibility for Adaptimmune

      sponsored clinical treatment trials studying the safety and efficacy of autologous

      genetically modified T-cells engineered with enhanced TCRs targeting specific antigens. No

      treatment intervention will occur as part of this screening study.



      For this screening study, subjects with confirmed solid or hematological malignancies will

      be required to provide a tumor specimen and a blood sample for diagnostic analysis. The

      tumor biopsy will be screened at a central reference laboratory for the expression (gene or

      protein) of multiple antigens. The antigens to be screened may include, but are not limited

      to the following: NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a, MAGE-A10, and others to be determined. The blood

      sample will be used for HLA subtype analysis. Based upon both the tumor antigen expression

      and the HLA subtype, if eligible, subjects will be referred to appropriate available

      clinical treatment trial(s) at the discretion of the investigator.



      The secondary objective of the study is the development and validation of companion

      diagnostic assay(s) for antigen expression profiling. Therefore, following screening for

      eligibility onto a treatment trial(s), all tumor specimens will be retained by Adaptimmune

      for companion diagnostic validation purposes.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a single-arm phase II trial of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with advanced,

      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary objective is to assess its therapeutic

      efficacy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary endpoint

      is disease-control rate (DCR) defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall

      response of either a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)

      (that is maintained for at least 8 weeks).



      Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),

      objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and toxicity profile of

      Pembrolizumab. The investigators will also evaluate the expression levels of Programmed

      death-ligand 1 (PD-L-1) in tumor tissue, as well as serum titers of hepatitis B or C in

      patients with hepatitis B or C, respectively, for whom specimens are available.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The study will be an open-label, single-institution, non-randomized, single-arm, Phase II

      study of pembrolizumab therapy in patients with advanced HCC. Patients will be treated in

      three-week cycles, with intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab on day 1 of each

      3-week cycle. Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression

      and/or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.



      Correlative studies investigating PD-L-1 expression in tumor tissue will be assessed with

      clinical outcome. Peripheral blood will also be drawn to perform immunologic markers and

      hepatitis B or C viral titers. This is to determine if viral titers change with treatment.

      These studies are included for all patients who consent to the correlative studies (See

      Appendix F). There is an additional consent for the correlative studies.



      Up to 28 patients will be enrolled at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC).

      Investigators expect to enroll 10-12 patients per year based on the institution's enrollment

      capacity. Expected time to complete total accrual is approximately 1.5 years. Expected time

      to study completion is 3 years from date open to enrollment to allow for survival data. An

      interim analysis is planned after 14 evaluable patients are assessed for DCR to determine

      whether to continue with an additional 14 more.

    <brief_summary>

      Carotid revascularization for primary prevention of stroke (CREST-2) is two independent

      multicenter, randomized controlled trials of carotid revascularization and intensive medical

      management versus medical management alone in patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid

      stenosis. One trial will randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to endarterectomy versus no

      endarterectomy and another will randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio to carotid stenting with

      embolic protection versus no stenting. Medical management will be uniform for all randomized

      treatment groups and will be centrally directed.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Prevention of stroke involves managing and treating risk factors. Most strokes are caused

      when blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked. One place this often happens is in the

      carotid artery. This blockage is called atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.



      The purpose of this trial is to determine the best way to prevent strokes in people who have

      a high amount of blockage of their carotid artery but no stroke symptoms related to that

      blockage. Each eligible participant will be evaluated to determine which procedure(s) is

      best for him/her. All participants will receive intensive medical treatment. In addition,

      participants will be randomized to receive the selected procedure or not.



      The trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada by physicians carefully selected

      on their ability to perform the procedures at low risk. Another key component of the trial

      is that important stroke risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,

      cigarette smoking, physical activity, and diet will be managed intensively. Participants

      will remain in the study for 4 years.

        Specific Carotid Artery Stenting Exclusion Criteria



        Patients who are being considered for revascularization by CAS must not have any of the

        following criteria:



          1. Allergy to intravascular contrast dye not amenable to pre-medication.

    <brief_summary>

      This study, will take a subject's "T cells" and "teach" them to be able to recognize and

      attack the ovarian cancer cells. This is done by putting in a gene or genetic material that

      will change how a subject's T cells work and hopefully get them to attack and kill ovarian

      cancer cells. These new T cells are called "engineered T cells" because the new gene is

      causing them to become directed toward the ovarian cancer cells rather than their usual

      targets. These are also called "gene-modified T cells". For subjects who have the HLA A2

      tissue-type marker, the T cells would be engineered to recognize a substance called

      "NY-ESO-1". After putting this new gene in T cells (a procedure called "gene therapy") the

      investigators will grow the cells in the laboratory and give these cells back to subjects.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is an open label clinical trial. Patients with the HLA-A201, HLA-A205, and/or HLA-A206

      allele and whose tumor expresses the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen will be eligible to receive

      NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. The trial is conducted entirely with outpatient procedures; however, patients

      may be hospitalized for the cytoreductive chemotherapy at the discretion of the

      investigator. Upon enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis for T cell collection,

      and their cells will be genetically engineered and expanded ex vivo. Seven days prior to

      receiving T-cells patients will undergo a cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen to

      potentiate the immunotherapy. The cell product will be infused as a single infusion (Day 0,

      typically Monday) to mitigate risks associated with unanticipated infusion reactions.

      Patients will be followed daily for the first week, weekly until 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12

      weeks and then at 6 months and every 3 months until disease progression. Patients will

      undergo disease monitoring by MRI/CT scan (as appropriate for disease) at baseline, day 28,

      8 weeks and 12 weeks, and months 6, and every 3 months until progression. Tumor biopsies

      will be taken at baseline, Week 8, and upon progression. In patients who have progressive

      disease following initial infusion but whose tumors continue to express NY-ESO-1, these

      patients may be eligible for a second infusion with redirected T cells. At disease

      progression, the interventional portion of the protocol ends and long term follow-up (LTFU)

      begins, in accordance with FDA regulations. LTFU occurs semiannually for up to 5 years post

      infusion and then annually thereafter for up to 15 years.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of alisertib and its effect, bad and/or

      good, on acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) or myelofibrosis (MF). The study drug,

      alisertib, is an investigational drug. An investigational drug is one that has not been

      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Alisertib has shown evidence in the

      lab that it may have an effect on a type of cell that produces platelets. This cell is

      called a megakaryocyte and it is known to be defective (doesn't work well) in both AMKL and

      MF.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Determine the safety profile of alisertib in patients with acute megakaryoblastic

      leukemia (AMKL) and in patients with myelofibrosis (MF).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Determine preliminary efficacy of alisertib in both populations.



      TERCIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Describe pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of alisertib in peripheral blood and/or bone

      marrow samples.



      II. Evaluate the relationship between biomarker expression levels and response to alisertib.



      III. Evaluate reduction in splenomegaly by palpation (MF arm only). IV. Evaluate improvement

      in MF symptoms (MF arm only), as assessed by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom

      Assessment form (MPN-SAF).



      V. Assess change in bone marrow fibrosis in patients in the MF arm.



      OUTLINE:



      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Courses repeat every

      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 30 days and 6

      months.

      Design



      - Patients will undergo apheresis at the enrolling institution. Fresh PBMC will be shipped

      to a central manufacturer for gene transduction, activation and expansion, then

      cryopreserved and shipped back to the enrolling institution.



        -  Patients will undergo lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide on Days -3 and -2 with or

           without fludarabine on Days -5 to -2. On Day 0, patients will receive a target dose of

           5x10⁹/kg with a minimum of 1x10⁹/kg to a maximum of 6x10⁹ transduced NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T.



        -  The trial seeks to enroll up to 65 patients, that is, up to 20 patients in Cohort 1 and

           up to 15 patients in Cohorts 2-4.



        -  Cohort 1: Complete



        -  Cohort 2: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable patients

           treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T.



        -  Cohort 3: Up to 15 patients may be enrolled to achieve at least 10 evaluable patients

           treated with NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T.



      Patients ≥40 kg will receive the minimum cell dose of at least 1x10⁹ transduced

      NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells with a maximum of 6x10⁹ transduced cells. The target dose for this

      protocol is 5x10⁹ transduced NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells. Patients &lt;40 kg will be dosed per body

      weight with a minimum 0.025x10⁹ transduced cells/kg, with a target dose of 0.125x10⁹

      transduced cells/kg.



        -  Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and immune endpoints.



        -  Patients who have a confirmed response, or have stable disease for &gt;3 months then

           progress may receive a 2nd cycle of treatment, provided eligibility criteria are met.

           The 2nd cycle of treatment will be administered in the same manner as the first

           treatment. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria may receive a 2nd treatment of

           NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T no sooner than 60 days and no later than 2 years following completion of

           the first treatment.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled

      efficacy and safety study of postoperative pain in adults who are scheduled for unilateral

      inguinal hernioplasty via open laparotomy (tension-free technique).



      Patients will assess their postoperative pain intensity (PI) using an 11-point numerical

      rating scale (NRS) from 0 hour through 72 hours postoperatively.



      The expected maximum study duration for each patient will be up to 60 days, including a

      maximum 30-day screening period, the day of surgery and implantation, and a 30-day post

      implantation period including treatment and follow-up.

    <detailed_description>

      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled

      study in adults who are scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernioplasty via open laparotomy

      (tension-free technique). Patients will receive either 3 XaraColl Bupivacaine Implants each

      containing 100 mg of bupivacaine hydrochloride, for a 300 mg total dose; or 3

      placebo-sponges.



      Three test article sponges will be implanted according to the patient's blinded treatment

      assignment. Following surgery, patients will be transferred to a postanesthesia care unit

      (PACU) and/or other postoperative recovery area for observation where they may receive

      parenteral morphine as needed (rescue medication for breakthrough pain) and on request for

      pain control. Once patients can tolerate oral medication, they will commence a standardized

      oral analgesic regimen with additional PRN medication to manage breakthrough pain only when

      it occurs.



      Patients will assess their postoperative pain intensity (PI) using an 11-point numerical

      rating scale (NRS) from 0 hour through 72 hours postoperatively.



      Patients will be observed postoperatively for a minimum of 3 hours and may be discharged at

      any time following completion of their 3-hour vital sign and PI assessments. Patients will

      be contacted at approximately 6, 24 and 48 hours after implantation to ensure protocol

      compliance and to perform safety assessments (including AEs and concomitant medications). At

      72 hours, patients will return to the clinic to perform their final PI assessment, complete

      a categorical assessment of their overall pain control, and for follow-up safety

      assessments. They will also be asked to record the incidence of any ongoing or subsequent

      AEs (and any associated treatment) through Day 7. Additional follow-up assessments for

      safety will be performed at postoperative Day 7 (telephone call) and Days 15 and 30 (clinic

      visits).

           for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks without GED-0301 treatment) for an additional 44

           weeks. Subjects who do not achieve at least a 20% decrease in partial mayo score (PMS)

           from baseline at Week 12 will be discontinued from the study.



      Clinical, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis,

      however, if the response to treatment is lower than expected (eg, ≤2 subjects achieving

      clinical remission based on modified Mayo score (MMS)) when 50% of the subjects complete

      Week 8, or discontinue before Week 8, the study team will review available data (clinical,

      safety, and PK) to evaluate if the study conduct should be modified.



      This evaluation will be based on clinical judgment and the following guidance



        -  Consider starting a new cohort of subjects using a QD dose up to 320 mg if there is

           endoscopic or histologic evidence of proximal colon benefit but limited or no distal

           colon drug exposure/efficacy. Also, there is evidence of potential overall efficacy

           (total Mayo score (TMS), MMS,PMS) outcomes and acceptable safety (adverse events

           (AEs)/vitals/clinical laboratory test results) and exposure (PK).



        -  Consider to terminate the study if there is no evidence of drug exposure/efficacy in

           the colon observed by endoscopy or biopsy nor evidence of potential overall efficacy

           (TMS, MMS, PMS) outcomes or unacceptable safety(AEs/labs/vitals) or exposure (PK).



        -  Continue the study with the GED-0301 160 mg QD dose. If the GED-0301 160 mg QD dose

           group is discontinued and a new dose group is added, an additional 40 subjects will be

           enrolled in the new dose group. Subjects enrolled subsequent to the decision to adjust

           the dose of GED-0301, will receive the following treatments:



        -  Induction Phase - GED-0301, up to 320 mg QD, for 8 weeks;



        -  Extension Phase- GED-0301, up to 320 mg on alternating dosing schedule (GED-0301, up to

           320 mg QD for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks without GED-0301 treatment) for an

           additional 44 weeks. Subjects who do not achieve at least a 20% decrease in the PMS

           from baseline at Week 12 will be discontinued from the study. Actively enrolled

           subjects will not be affected by the dose adjustment. Subjects receiving

           corticosteroids at baseline will start tapering their corticosteroids at Week 8 (the

           end of the Induction Phase) if they achieve clinical response, defined as a decrease

           from baseline of at least 2 points and at least 25%, along with a reduction in the RBS

           of at least 1 point or an absolute RBS ≤ 1 in the MMS. The endoscopy subscore assessed

           by the investigator will be used for the calculation of the Week 8 MMS.



      The study will consist of 4 phases:



        -  Screening Phase - up to 4 weeks



        -  Induction Phase - 8 weeks



        -  Extension Phase - 44 weeks



        -  Observational Follow-up Phase - 4 weeks Subjects who complete the Extension Phase, and

           those subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study for any reason, will enter

           the post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase, the 4-week period after the last dose

           of Investigational Product(IP). The study will be conducted in compliance with

           International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

    <brief_title>Axitinib and Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Advanced Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma and Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
    <official_title>A Phase II Trial of Concurrent Axitinib and Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Advanced Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS) and Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS)</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      The investigators hypothesize that combination axitinib with pembrolizumab will improve

      progression-free survival relative to historical controls.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The study will be a single-institution, open-label, single-arm phase II study. Since the

      primary endpoint is survival outcome, progression-free survival (PFS) sample size

      calculation is based on a single-arm survival design. The investigators will employ early

      stopping rules for lack of efficacy, based on previously reported historical controls (19%

      PFS at 3 months) and a large database suggesting that a progression-free rate at 3 months of

      &gt; 40% correlates with an active drug in the second-line setting for patients with advanced

      sarcoma.



      Patients will be treated with twice daily dosing of axitinib alone for the first 7 days,

      followed by concurrent axitinib administered twice daily at 5 mg orally (PO), plus

      intravenous administration of pembrolizumab every 21 days. Patients will be assessed every

      three weeks for toxicity. After the first five patients are enrolled, the investigators will

      assess safety of the combination. If 2 or fewer patients exhibit dose-limiting toxicity

      (DLT), the investigators will then proceed with intrapatient titration of axitinib dosing at

      each cycle based on the presence or absence of predefined toxicities.



      Correlative studies characterizing T-cells in tumor tissue and in peripheral blood will be

      performed at three timepoints: 1. pre-treatment, 2. on-treatment on cycle 3 day 1, and 3.

      off-study. Additional exploratory imaging investigations, and assessment of circulating

      tumor cells are included for all patients.



      Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable

      toxicity, whichever occurs first.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel group

      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADS-5102 extended release (ER) capsules, an

      investigational formulation of amantadine, dosed once nightly at bedtime for the treatment

      of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The novel

      pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) maximal concentrations in the

      early morning through mid-day, when LID can be troublesome, and ii) lower concentrations in

      the evening, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep. This

      pharmacokinetic profile could enable higher doses to be tolerated with a once-nightly ER

      formulation than can be tolerated with an immediate-release formulation. The once-nightly

      dosing regimen may also provide enhanced convenience and compliance.



      In a previous clinical study, ADS-5102 met its primary endpoint; LID was significantly

      reduced as measured by the change in UDysRS score over 8 weeks vs. placebo.

      The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability and evidence of

      activity of multiple intravitreal (IVT) injections of APL-2 in subjects with Geographic

      Atrophy associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a Phase II, prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-masked, sham-controlled

      study to assess the safety, tolerability and evidence of activity of multiple IVT injections

      of APL-2 in subjects with GA associated with Age-Related Macular Degeneration.



      Patients diagnosed with GA associated with age-related macular degeneration in the study eye

      and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in the study. The study will

      randomize approximately 240 subjects to obtain at least 200 evaluable subjects across 40

      multinational sites.



      Subjects should be screened within 14 days before receiving APL-2. Upon entry into the

      study, subjects will be assigned a screening number. Patients who meet all inclusion and

      exclusion criteria and are confirmed as eligible by the CRC will return to the clinic for

      randomization and treatment on visit 2 (Day 0). At this visit, subjects will be randomized

      in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive APL 2 Monthly (AM), APL-2 Every-Other-Month (AEOM), Sham

      injection Monthly (SM) or Sham injection Every-Other-Month (SEOM), respectively.



      All subjects will return to the clinical site on Day 7 to assess acute safety after the

      first injection. After that, subjects in the monthly groups will return to the clinical site

      for additional APL-2 (or Sham) injections and study procedures every month until Month 12.

      Subjects in the Every-Other-Month groups will return to the clinical site for additional

      APL-2 (or Sham) injections and study procedures every two months until Month 12. All

      subjects will return for follow-up visits on Months 15 and 18 (3 and 6 months after last

      injection, respectively).

             Note: clinical trials solely involving observation, over-the-counter vitamins,

             supplements, or diets are not exclusionary.



         14. Medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, make

             consistent follow-up over the treatment period unlikely, or in general a poor medical

             risk because of other systemic diseases or active uncontrolled infections.



         15. Any screening laboratory value (hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis) that in

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II/III trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab and

      ipilimumab when given together with or without sargramostim and to see how well they work in

      treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal

      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may kill tumor cells by blocking blood flow to

      the tumor, by stimulating white blood cells to kill the tumor cells, or by attacking

      specific tumor cells and stop them from growing or kill them. Colony-stimulating factors,

      such as sargramostim, may increase the production of white blood cells. It is not yet known

      whether nivolumab and ipilimumab are more effective with or without sargramostim in treating

      patients with melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To compare the overall survival (OS) of nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF (sargramostim) versus

      nivolumab/ipilimumab.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with

      nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF versus nivolumab/ipilimumab.



      II. To assess for differences in tolerability, specifically the rate of grade III or higher

      adverse events, between nivolumab/ipilimumab/GM-CSF versus nivolumab/ipilimumab.



      III. To evaluate immune-related response rate (based on immune-related response criteria and

      response rate (based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria) and

      to compare them.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM I: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on

      day 1, ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1, and sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) on days

      1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or

      unacceptable toxicity.



      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab and sargramostim as in Induction therapy.

      Patients with partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or complete response (CR) at 24

      weeks may continue maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable

      toxicity.



      ARM II: INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab and ipilimumab as in Arm I. Treatment

      repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable

      toxicity.



      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive nivolumab as in Induction therapy. Patients with PR,

      SD, or CR at 24 weeks may continue maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression

      or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and

      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <brief_summary>

      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate a method involving a blood test,

      called CA-125, that may be helpful in the early detection of ovarian cancer in

      post-menopausal women.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Currently, there are no effective tests to detect ovarian cancer at its earliest stage.

      CA-125 is an FDA approved marker for detecting if the disease has come back in women who

      have already had ovarian cancer. Tumor markers may be related to the status of the disease.



      If you are eligible to take part in this research study, you will have blood (about 2-3

      tablespoons) drawn every year while on study.



      You will need to provide the name of a gynecologist or qualified healthcare professional

      willing to provide follow-up care, if needed.



      Each time blood is drawn, the CA-125 analysis will be performed. If the CA-125 analysis

      shows that you are at a low risk of developing ovarian cancer, you will be asked to repeat

      the blood test in one year. If the CA-125 analysis shows that you are at a slightly higher

      risk, you will be asked to repeat the blood test in 3 months. If the CA-125 analysis shows

      that you are at an even higher risk, you will be asked to have a transvaginal ultrasound.



      An ultrasound test uses sound waves to check the position, size, and shape of the ovaries.

      During a transvaginal ultrasound, a small probe will be placed in your vagina and used to

      create and measure sound waves. Based on the results of the transvaginal ultrasound, you and

      the study doctor will discuss options for further treatment or standard cancer management.



      All study participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire. You will be contacted to

      collect follow-up information, and to make sure that you return for the follow-up blood

      draws. When you return for screening, your health status will be updated in your medical

      record before or at each visit, and any changes to your medical or cancer history will be

      noted. If you were not seen at a visit, the study staff will try to contact you by telephone

      or letter. Your medical information may also be updated using MD Anderson's Medical

      Informatics Section, or state tumor registries.



      Your name or other identifying information will not be used at any time blood samples are

      drawn. Each sample will have an identifying number. Only the study coordinator will have the

      match between the identifying number and your identity.



      Length of Participation:



      Women will be enrolled on this study for up to 15 years, plus 1 year of follow-up. Your

      participation on this study may last up to 16 years.



      This is an investigational study. Transvaginal ultrasound scans on this study are performed

      using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.



      Up to 30,000 women will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 9500 will be enrolled at

      MD Anderson.

    <brief_summary>

      The use of dehydrated human amnionic membrane allograft will result in an absolute 20%

      increase (from 40-60%) in the proportion of men considered potent (Sexual History Inventory

      for Men (SHIM) score &gt;/= 19) 12 months post robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP)

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a phase 2 prospective randomized trial investigating the impact of amniotic membrane

      placement over the neurovascular bundles after bilateral nerve sparing robot assisted

      radical prostatectomy on potency. The study will have a control arm that will follow

      standard of care surgery, without placement of any membranes.140 men will be allocated to

      each arm.



      Randomization of study patients will be done in equal proportion to Arm I (membrane

      placement) and Arm II (no membrane placement, standard of care surgery) using a permuted

      block design stratified by baseline age (≤ 65 vs. &gt; 65), and use of any erectile aids (Yes

      vs. No) in the last 3 months.



      Patients will be followed up every three months for a total of one year. This follow up

      schedule meets the current standard of care after radical prostatectomy. At each follow up a

      serum PSA will be assessed for recurrence on prostate cancer. To investigate primary and

      secondary endpoints a self-reported validated questionnaire will be provided assessing

      measures of potency. Finally, the use of pads for urinary leakage will be assessed at each

      time point.



      The research study will end at 12 months from radical prostatectomy of the last enrolled

      patient

    <brief_summary>

      Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology. Patients suffer from

      multiple organ fibrosis whereas lung fibrosis (interstitial lung disease, ILD) is one of the

      main driver for mortality. There is preclinical evidence for efficacy of nintedanib in SSc

      and associated ILD (SSc-ILD) and the anti-fibrotic efficacy of nintedanib was proven in

      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients, who are presenting a similar pattern regarding lung

      fibrosis. Hence it is the purpose of the trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of

      nintedanib 150 mg bid in treating patients with SSc-ILD, compared with placebo. The trial

      will be conducted as a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with primary

      efficacy evaluation at week 52 and placebo-controlled treatment until last patient out (up

      to a maximum of 100 weeks). Respiratory function is globally accepted for assessment of

      treatment effects in patients with lung fibrosis. The chosen endpoint (Forced Vital Capacity

      (FVC) decline) is easy to obtain and is part of the usual examinations done in patients with

      SSc-ILD.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies how well high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or

      ipilimumab works compared with pembrolizumab in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma

      that has been removed by surgery but is likely to come back or spread. High-dose recombinant

      interferon alfa-2B may help shrink or slow the growth of melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies,

      such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting

      certain cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B or

      ipilimumab is more effective than pembrolizumab in treating patients with melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To compare overall survival (OS) of patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma

      treated with high dose interferon alfa-2b (recombinant interferon alfa-2b) or ipilimumab

      versus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).



      II. Among patients who are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive, to compare OS of

      patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma treated with high dose interferon alfa-2b

      or ipilimumab versus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).



      III. To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with resected stage III and IV

      melanoma treated with high dose interferon alfa-2b or ipilimumab to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).



      IV. Among patients who are PD-L1 positive, to compare RFS of patients with resected stage

      III and IV melanoma treated with high dose interferon alfa-2b or ipilimumab to MK-3475

      (pembrolizumab).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate OS and RFS for patients who are PD-L1 negative or PD-L1 indeterminate in this

      population.



      II. To compare OS and RFS of patients between the two regimens within PD-L1 positive and

      negative subgroups and to look at the interaction between PD-L1 (positive versus negative)

      and treatment arm.



      III. To assess the safety and tolerability of the regimens.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To bank tissue and whole blood in anticipation of future correlative studies in this

      patient population.



      II. To evaluate PD-L1 expression through immunohistochemistry assay. III. To evaluate the

      effect of treatment-related side effects that may have an impact on the health-related

      domains of quality of life (QOL) using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy

      (FACT)-Biological Response Modifiers (BRM) and European Quality of Life Five Dimension Three

      Level Scale (EQ-5D-3L) between patients treated with high-dose interferon alfa-2b or

      ipilimumab and MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).



      IV. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing will be performed on all

      patients receiving MK-3475 (pembrolizumab). These analyses will evaluate: exposure-response

      analyses for activity and efficacy, potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers, and the safety of

      MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM I:



      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B intravenously

      (IV) over 20 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of

      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Or patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90

      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 4 courses in the absence of

      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B

      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 48 weeks

      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Or patients receive

      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for 3 years in the

      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every

      3 weeks for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 6 and 12 weeks,

      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 5

      years.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term safety and tolerability of ALK-001

      (C20-D3-retinyl acetate), and to explore the effects of ALK-001 on the progression of

      Stargardt disease in patients between the ages of 12 and 60 years old.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, placebo-controlled study

      evaluating the effects of ALK-001 administered daily by mouth in subjects with Stargardt

      disease (ABCA4-related).



      Stargardt disease is a rare genetic disorder that leads to damage to the retina and results

      in legal blindness. The onset of symptoms usually occurs during one's teenage years,

      although symptoms can appear in children as young as 4 years old. There is currently no

      treatment for Stargardt.



      Stargardt disease is caused by a defective ABCA4 gene, which affects the processing of

      vitamin A in the eye and leads to the formation of toxic vitamin A aggregates (called

      "vitamin A dimers") in the eye. Vitamin A dimers are thought to contribute to vision loss in

      Stargardt disease. ALK-001 is a chemically-modified vitamin A designed as a replacement of

      vitamin A. ALK-001 has been changed specifically to prevent the formation of toxic vitamin A

      dimers in the eye, without altering the normal processing of vitamin A to enable vision.



      Trial participants will be randomly assigned to receive ALK-001 (30 subjects) or placebo (20

      subjects) for one year. After one year of treatment, half of the participants (10 subjects)

      receiving placebo will be randomly crossed over to receive ALK-001 for the following 12

      months, while the remaining 10 subjects will continue on the placebo. All subjects initially

      receiving ALK-001 will remain on the same treatment for 12 months.



      Follow-up visits will take place 4 and 8 weeks after the initiation of treatment to assess

      safety and tolerability, then after 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months to assess the safety,

      tolerability and effects of ALK-001 on the progression of Stargardt disease.



      The study is double-masked so that neither the participants, the clinical staff, nor the

      sponsor, are aware of the treatment allocation (ALK-001 or placebo). A Data Safety

      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and efficacy data throughout the study.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose study of

      ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or tenofovir administered to patients with HBeAg

      positive and immune active chronic HBV infection, who have been receiving ongoing entecavir

      or tenofovir therapy. Patients who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Ethics

      Committee-approved informed consent, and have met all of the protocol eligibility criteria

      will continue receiving daily oral entecavir (0.5-1.0 mg/day) or daily oral tenofovir (300

      mg/day) and either ARC-520 at 1.0 mg/kg or placebo for 3 total doses administered once every

      four weeks. Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the

      study: medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure,

      heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), weight, adverse events assessment (AEs),

      echocardiograms, 12-lead ECGs, liver fibrosis testing, concomitant medication assessment,

      blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, Pharmacokinetic (PK) and

      exploratory Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, HBV serology, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)

      testing (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing for females of childbearing

      potential. Patients will be monitored for a total of 21 weeks. Clinically significant

      changes including AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes,

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine which patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, and

      primary peritoneal cancer will best respond to treatment with rucaparib.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate

      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated

      with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD). The safety and efficacy of

      rucaparib has been evaluated in several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. An oral formulation is

      the focus of current development efforts. Rucaparib is currently being investigated as

      monotherapy in patients with cancer associated with breast cancer susceptibility gene 1

      (BRCA1) or BRCA2 mutations.



      Clinical data with PARP inhibitors indicate there is an ovarian cancer patient population

      beyond just those with germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutations that may benefit from treatment with

      a PARP inhibitor. This study will define a molecular signature of HRD in ovarian cancer that

      correlates with response to rucaparib and enables selection of appropriate ovarian cancer

      patients for treatment with rucaparib. The HRD signature will be based on an association

      between the extent of genomic scarring (a downstream consequence of HRD) in a patient's

      tumor and observed clinical benefit from rucaparib treatment. Genomic scarring can be

      assessed by quantifying the extent of loss of heterozygosity across the tumor genome (tumor

      genomic LOH). One of the main advantages of detecting tumor genomic LOH is that it can

      identify HRD tumors regardless of the underlying mechanisms, which include both known (i.e.,

      BRCA mutations) and unknown genetic and other mechanisms.



      Once determined, this signature will be prospectively applied to ARIEL2 PART 2 and ARIEL3.

      This Phase 2 study (ARIEL2) will also compare archival versus recently collected tumor

      tissue in order to validate the use of archival tumor tissue for assessment of HRD status in

      ARIEL3.



      This study will include 2 parts:



      PART 1 (completed enrollment): Evaluation of HRD status and rucaparib efficacy in patients

      who received ≥1 prior platinum-based regimen and had platinum-sensitive disease



      PART 2 (currently enrolling): Evaluation of HRD status and rucaparib efficacy in patients

      who received at least 3 prior chemotherapy regimens

    <brief_summary>

      This clinical trial studies the physical function and quality-of-life before and after

      surgery in patients with stage I cervical cancer. Studying quality-of-life in patients

      undergoing surgery for cervical cancer may help determine the intermediate-term and

      long-term effects of surgery.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To examine the changes before and after non-radical surgical treatment (simple

      hysterectomy or cone biopsy [fertility preservation]) and pelvic lymphadenectomy) on

      functional outcomes of bladder, bowel, and sexual function for stage IA1 (lymphatic vessel

      invasion positive [LVSI+]) and IA2-IB1 (=&lt; 2 cm) carcinoma of the cervix.



      II. To evaluate incidence and severity of lymphedema after non-radical surgery (simple

      hysterectomy or cone biopsy [fertility preservation] and pelvic lymphadenectomy) for stage

      IA1 (LVSI+) and IA2-IB1 (=&lt; 2 cm) carcinoma of the cervix.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To investigate if non-radical surgery (simple hysterectomy or cone biopsy [fertility

      preservation] with pelvic lymphadenectomy) demonstrates greater physical function and less

      toxicity in comparison to historical data on radical surgery (radical hysterectomy or

      radical trachelectomy).



      II. To evaluate incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events, including

      surgical complications, among the entire cohort and by treatment type.



      III. To evaluate changes in quality of life (QOL) (Functional Assessment of Cancer

      Therapy-Cervix [FACT-Cx]), cancer worries (Impact of Events Scale [IES]) and sexual (Female

      Sexual Function Index [FSFI])/reproductive concerns (RCS) among the entire cohort and by

      treatment type.



      IV. To explore relationships (correlation, interaction, independence) between functional

      outcomes (i.e., bladder function, bowel function, sexual function), adverse events

      (including and surgical complication lymphedema [Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire

      (GCLQ)]), cancer worry (IES), surgical complications, and overall quality of life (FACT-Cx).



      V. To determine participants' intention for conception &amp; fertility rates (Integrative Care

      for Fertility [ICF]) and assess the reproductive concerns (RCS) of women following cone

      biopsy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for stage IA1 (LVSI+) and IA2-IB1 (=&lt; 2 cm) carcinoma of

      the cervix.



      VI. To estimate the efficacy of non-radical surgery (simple hysterectomy or cone biopsy

      [fertility preservation] and pelvic lymphadenectomy) for stage IA1 (LVSI+) and IA2-IB1 (=&lt; 2

      cm) carcinoma of the cervix.



      OUTLINE:



      Patients undergo cone biopsy and pelvic lymphadenectomy or simple hysterectomy and pelvic

      lymphadenectomy.



      Patients complete the FACT-Cx, the IES, the FSFI, the GCLQ, and the Patient Reported

      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires at baseline, 4-6 weeks after

      surgery, and then every 6 months for 3 years. Patients undergoing cone biopsy and pelvic

      lymphadenectomy also complete the ICF and RCS questionnaires.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months

      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

    <detailed_description>

      This is a multi-center, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm

      efficacy and safety study in subjects newly diagnosed with AL amyloidosis. Approximately 236

      subjects will be enrolled in ~60 centers, with approximately 118 subjects per arm.



      This is an event driven trial, therefore subjects will remain on-study until study

      completion, which will occur when all primary endpoint events (all-cause mortality or

      cardiac hospitalizations) have been reached. All subjects who discontinue will be followed

      until the last event is adjudicated. The estimated overall study duration is approximately

      42 months, including the enrollment and treatment periods



      Study drug will be administered once every 28 days as a 60-120 minute IV infusion.



      First-line chemotherapy must be a proteasome inhibitor-containing regimen, with the

      proteasome inhibitor administered weekly. The number of cycles of first-line chemotherapy

      that are administered are at the discretion of the Investigator, and subsequent chemotherapy

      regimens may be prescribed as per standard of care at the Investigator's discretion.



      An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review data on a regular basis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate endoscopic remission at Week 26 as assessed by

      ileocolonoscopy.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to

      treat people who have Crohn's disease. This study will look at mucosal healing in people who

      take vedolizumab.



      The study will enroll approximately 100 patients and will be conducted in 2 Parts. Part A

      will consist of a 26-week treatment period and all participants will receive vedolizumab 300

      mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 6, 14 and 22. Part B will consist of a

      26-week extension treatment period and all participants will receive vedolizumab 300 mg IV

      at Weeks 30, 38, and 46.



      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this

      study is approximately 70 weeks for Parts A, B and 18-Week Follow-up combined. Participants

      will make multiple visits to the clinic. All participants included in the study will also

      have a 6 month safety follow-up telephone call following his/her last dose of study drug.

    <brief_summary>

      This single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat adult patients who have relapsed or

      refractory B-ALL with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been genetically

      modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that will bind to leukemia cells that

      express the CD19 protein on the cell surface. The study will determine if these modified T

      cells (called JCAR015) help the body's immune system eliminate leukemia cells. The trial

      will also study the safety of treatment with JCAR015, how long JCAR015 cells stay in the

      patient's body, the extent to which JCAR015 eliminates minimal residual disease, and the

      impact of this treatment on survival.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of

      JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will have the

      following sequential phases: Part A (screening, leukapheresis, cell product preparation, and

      cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for

      each participant is approximately 12 months after the final JCAR015 infusion. The total

      duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years. Long-term follow-up for

      survival, toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term

      follow-up protocol per health regulatory authority guidelines, currently up to 15 years

      after the last JCAR015 infusion.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the antiretroviral activity of MK-1439A, a

      single-tablet, once-daily (q.d.) fixed-dose combination (FDC) containing MK-1439 100 mg +

      lamivudine 300 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, with ATRIPLA™, a single-tablet FDC

      containing efavirenz 600 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg,

      in treatment-naive participants infected with HIV. The primary hypothesis is that MK-1439A

      q.d. is non-inferior to ATRIPLA™ q.d. as assessed by the proportion of participants with

      HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL (by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay) at Week 48.

    <brief_summary>

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how PLX9486 may affect cancer cells

      with certain mutations in the KIT gene, specifically in patients with types of advanced

      solid tumors including Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST).



      PLX9486 is designed to block KIT gene mutations. These mutations can cause cancer and cancer

      cell growth. By blocking these mutations, the drug may kill the cancer cells with the

      mutation and/or stop the tumor from growing. By combining PLX9486 with PLX3397, the

      investigators hope to block most gene mutations in KIT.

      This trial will enroll approximately 6,000 patients with recent embolic stroke of unknown

      source (ESUS). Patients will be randomized to dabigatran or acetylsalicyclic acid (ASA) (1:1

      ratio) and have visits every three months. The study doctor may prescribe blinded

      concomitant ASA for pts with coronary artery disease but this is not mandatory. All Adverse

      Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), outcome events will be recorded. The trial will

      conclude when the required number of stroke events are positively adjudicated which is

      estimated to take 3 years (including 2.5 years of enrollment).

             aortic, bioprosthetic or mechanical), e) atrial myxoma, f) other cardiac tumors, g)

             moderate or severe mitral stenosis, h) recent (&lt; 4weeks) myocardial infarction, i)

             valvular vegetations, or j) infective endocarditis.



          -  Any indication that requires treatment with an anticoagulant as per Investigator`s

             judgment.

          -  Other specific stroke etiology (i.e. cerebral arteritis or arterial dissection,

             migraine with aura/vasospasm, drug abuse).



          -  Renal impairment with estimated creatinine clearance (as calculated by

             Cockcroft-Gault equation) &lt;30mL/min at screening, or where Investigator expects

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride, combination

      chemotherapy, and radiation therapy work and compares it to radiation therapy alone or in

      combination with pazopanib hydrochloride or combination chemotherapy in treating patients

      with newly diagnosed non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas that can be removed by

      surgery. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in

      chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to

      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,

      or by stopping them from spreading. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor

      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether

      radiation therapy works better when given with or without combination chemotherapy and/or

      pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To identify the dose of pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) that is feasible when given

      in combination with radiation or chemoradiation in pediatric and adult patients newly

      diagnosed with unresected intermediate- and high-risk non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue

      sarcomas (NRSTS).



      II. To compare the rates of near complete pathologic response (&gt; 90% necrosis) with the

      addition of pazopanib to preoperative chemoradiation versus preoperative chemoradiation

      alone for potentially resectable &gt; 5 cm, grade 3 intermediate to high risk

      chemotherapy-sensitive NRSTS in the phase II portion of the study for this cohort.



      III. To compare the rates of near complete pathologic response (&gt; 90% necrosis) with the

      addition of pazopanib to preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone

      for potentially resectable intermediate to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS in the phase

      II portion of the study for this cohort (using a phase II decision rule to go onto the phase

      III portion of the study).



      IV. To compare the rates of event-free survival (EFS) with the addition of pazopanib to

      preoperative radiotherapy versus preoperative radiotherapy alone for localized intermediate

      to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS in the phase III portion of the study for this cohort

      if the phase II decision rule is passed.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To estimate the rates of local failure, regional failure, distant metastasis free

      survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival with the addition of pazopanib to

      preoperative chemoradiation or preoperative radiation in intermediate to high risk adult and

      pediatric NRSTS.



      II. To compare the pattern of recurrence (local, regional and distant) between preoperative

      chemoradiation or radiation with the addition of pazopanib for adult and pediatric NRSTS.



      III. To define the toxicities of ifosfamide and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride)

      chemotherapy and radiation when used in combination with pazopanib in intermediate to high

      risk adult and pediatric NRSTS.



      IV. To define the toxicities of preoperative radiotherapy when used in combination with

      pazopanib in intermediate to high risk adult and pediatric NRSTS.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To gain insight into the disease biology of childhood and adult NRSTS through analysis of

      actionable mutations and whole genome sequencing.



      II. To determine if microvessel density and circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)

      predict response to pazopanib and outcome.



      III. To determine the effect of pazopanib on doxorubicin exposure in children and adults

      with NRSTS.



      IV. To evaluate change in fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)

      maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) from baseline to week 10 or 13 in patients with

      unresected tumors and to correlate this change with pathologic response and EFS.



      V. To compare the rate of response by standard imaging and pathologic assessment to

      determine which correlates better with local tumor control, distant tumor control, EFS, and

      overall survival.

    <brief_summary>

      Clinically, many patients with AD show no response or minimal response to antipsychotics for

      symptoms of agitation/aggression or psychosis, or they have intolerable side effects on

      these medications. Antipsychotics have a wide range of side effects, including the risk of

      increased mortality (60-70% higher rate of death on antipsychotic compared to placebo) that

      led to an FDA black box warning for patients with dementia; a more recent review and

      meta-analysis showed a 54% increased risk of mortality. In addition, some patients show only

      partial response to antipsychotics and symptoms persist. For these reasons, the

      investigators need to study alternative treatment strategies. Currently, there is no

      FDA-approved medication for the treatment of psychosis or agitation in AD.



      The investigators innovative project will examine the efficacy and side effects of low dose

      lithium treatment of agitation/aggression with or without psychosis in 80 patients with AD

      in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial (essentially a Phase II

      trial). The results will determine the potential for a large-scale clinical trial (Phase

      III) to establish the utility of lithium in these patients.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Symptoms of psychosis or agitation are common in Alzheimer's disease. These symptoms are

      associated with distress for the patient, an increased burden for caregivers, more rapid

      cognitive decline, greater risk of institutionalization and mortality, and increased health

      care costs. In a recent meta-analysis, caregiver education and behavior modification studies

      revealed a small to medium effect size in treating agitation in these patients. However,

      none of these studies were double-blind (difficult to achieve in such studies) and none had

      a control group that received the same amount of staff time as the intervention group,

      thereby biasing the results toward the active intervention.



      Among the psychotropic medications that have been studied, only antipsychotics have shown

      superiority over placebo for the treatment of psychosis and agitation in patients with

      dementia.



      However, most studies show only moderate superiority for antipsychotic over placebo and a

      few studies have been negative. The side effects of antipsychotic medications include

      sedation, extrapyramidal signs, tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, and the metabolic syndrome.

      A pooled analysis from 17 short-term trials showed that the mortality rate in patients with

      dementia receiving antipsychotic medications was 1.6 to 1.7 times as high (60-70% increase

      in mortality rate) as the mortality rate in patients receiving placebo. These findings led

      the FDA to issue a black-box warning for antipsychotic medication use in patients with

      dementia; a more recent meta-analysis reported a slightly lower odds ratio of 1.54 (54%

      increase in mortality rate).



      Lithium has several different actions from anticonvulsants, though both are effective in

      bipolar disorder, especially mania. Lithium is not being proposed here to treat mania in AD

      though the investigators will monitor symptoms on the Young Mania Rating Scale. In patients

      with AD, lithium has been studied for its putative cognitive enhancing effects. A few

      reports suggest that chronic lithium use reduces the risk of dementia, but other data show

      increased dementia risk with lithium use. A placebo-controlled, single-blind lithium trial

      showed no cognitive effects in patients with AD, but a recent trial of lithium in 45

      patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, which often leads to clinically diagnosable

      AD) showed a small advantage for lithium (n=24) over placebo (n=21) in attention and other

      cognitive domains. None of these studies with lithium were intended to treat psychosis or

      agitation in AD, and patients with these symptoms typically were excluded in these clinical

      trials.



      There has been no systematic placebo-controlled trial of lithium to treat

      agitation/aggression with or without psychosis in AD even though lithium is a highly

      effective treatment for mania with psychosis and symptoms of agitation or aggression.

      Nonetheless, the published studies of lithium to treat cognitive decline in older patients

      show that low-dose lithium is safe in patients with MCI or AD.



      Specific Aims and Hypotheses Specific Aim 1. To compare changes in agitation/aggression with

      or without psychosis in patients with AD who receive 12 weeks of randomized, double-blind

      treatment with lithium or placebo.



      Primary Hypothesis. Over these 12 weeks, the agitation/aggression domain score on the

      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) will decrease significantly more on lithium than placebo.



      Secondary Hypothesis. Over these 12 weeks, the proportion of responders on lithium will be

      significantly greater than the proportion of responders on placebo. Response is defined as a

      30% decrease in NPI core score (defined as the sum of domains for agitation/aggression,

      delusions and hallucinations) plus a CGI Change score of much improved or very much improved

      (CGI based on these behavioral symptoms only). Exploratory hypothesis. Over these 12 weeks,

      the psychosis score, measured by the sum of the NPI domain scores for delusions and

      hallucinations, will decrease significantly more on lithium than placebo. Specific Aim 2. To

      evaluate the tolerability of low dose lithium by assessing emergent somatic side effects

      over the course of the 12-week trial on lithium compared to placebo. Specific Aim 3. To

      explore associations between improvement on lithium (decrease in agitation/aggression and

      psychosis scores) and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (baseline, 12

      weeks), a SNP in intron 1 of the ACCN1 gene, and variation at the 7q11.2 gene locus, because

      these indices are associated with lithium response in bipolar disorder. The investigators do

      not postulate a specific mechanism of action for lithium in the investigators trial, but

      will evaluate these three potential predictors of lithium response with the aim of improving

      patient selection for personalized treatment. The investigators will examine BDNF serum

      levels as a biomarker correlate of lithium treatment by correlating change in BDNF levels

      with change in NPI agitation/aggression and psychosis scores.

             lithium treatment.



             Contraindications to lithium in this study include: resting tremor causing functional

             impairment, history of falls in the last month, untreated thyroid disease or any

             abnormal thyroid function test (T3, T4, or TSH), creatinine level greater than 1.5

             mg/100ml or a glomerular filtration rate less than 44ml/min/ 1.73m2; blood pressure &gt;

             disease (smallinfarcts, lacunes, periventricular disease) in the absence of clinical

             stroke with residual neurological deficits will not lead to exclusion.



          9. Acute, severe, unstable medical illness. For cancer, patients with active illness or

             metastases will be excluded, but past history of successfully treated cancer will not

             lead to exclusion.

      The cause of blood and bone marrow cancers is poorly understood; however, most research

      focuses on how cancer cells grow and develop. Because the causes of these cancers are

      unknown, current treatments may be unnecessarily harsh and often do not provide a cure.

      Identifying the causes of blood cancers would allow for the development of treatments that

      are more likely to provide a cure. To find the causes of blood and bone marrow cancers, we

      will look for specific cancer cell abnormalities that are responsible for cancer cell

      growth. We will then look to see if drugs that can reverse these abnormalities can kill

      cancer cells.

    <official_title>A Randomized Multicenter Phase Ib/II Study to Assess the Safety and the Immunological Effect of Chemoradiation Therapy (CRT) in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Compared to CRT Alone in Patients With Resectable or Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study an experimental drug called pembrolizumab or

      MK-3475 for use in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for patients with

      resectable (surgical removal) or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. In general,

      pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery is sometimes treated with chemotherapy

      and radiation therapy, called neoadjuvant treatment, to shrink the tumor so that surgery

      might be possible. However, this is not always effective at shrinking the tumor enough to

      allow it to be removed with surgery. Recent discoveries suggest that the investigators own

      immune system might have a role in controlling the growth of tumors. Drugs such as

      pembrolizumab can stimulate the immune system against cancer. The purpose of this study is

      to investigate whether pembrolizumab can be used safely during neoadjuvant treatment and can

      improve the body's immune response against pancreatic cancer.



      Pembrolizumab has been approved for treatment of patients with melanoma but has not been

      proven to be safe or helpful in patients with pancreatic cancer and is not approved by the

      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose.

      flexible-dose, study in participants with recent-onset schizophrenia or schizophreniform

      disorder to compare disease progression and disease modification following treatment with PP

      long-acting injection (once-monthly followed by 3-month injections) or OAP (Any of the

      following 7 OAPs are permitted: aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone ER,

      perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone). The study consists of 3 parts. Part-1 (Oral

      Run-In Phase), Part-2 (Disease Progression) and Part-3 (Extended Disease Progression and

      Disease Modification) with unique endpoints. Screening period will be up to 4 Weeks.

      Duration of Parts will be as: 2 months for Part-1, 9 months for Part-2 and Part-3. All

      participants will initially receive oral Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in Part-1. After

      paliperidone treatment in Part-1, participants will be randomized into 1:2 ratio to receive

      PP or OAP in Part-2. Participants who complete Part-2 will enter into Part-3 wherein OAP

      group participants of Part-2 will be re-randomized into 1:1 ratio to OAP-OAP group and

      OAP-PP group, and PP group will continue without further randomization. Treatment failures

      will be evaluated in Part-2 and Part-3 of the study. Also changes in cognition, functioning,

      brain intracortical myelin (ICM) volume will be evaluated in the study. Participants' safety

      will be monitored throughout.

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+DOXIL as a

      third-line chemotherapy regimen (treatment) in patients with platinum-sensitive

      advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who

      received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open - label

      (identity of assigned study drug will be known), active - controlled study in adult female

      patients with platinum-sensitive advanced - relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal,

      or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum - based chemotherapy.

      Approximately 670 participants will be enrolled. Patients will be stratified by 4 criteria

      defined in the protocol and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL

      combination therapy group (Arm A) or to the DOXIL (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin)

      monotherapy group (Arm B). During the treatment phase, patients will receive study drug

      infusions according to 21 - day cycles in Arm A and 28 - day cycles in Arm B. Treatment will

      continue until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity, or

      until 2 cycles after assessment of a complete response (CR). Efficacy assessments will be

      evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Disease assessments, including

      assessments for patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease

      progression, will be performed until disease progression, the start of subsequent anticancer

      therapy, withdrawal of consent, or the clinical cutoff date. Collection of survival status

      will continue until at least 514 deaths have been observed. Serial pharmacokinetic (PK)

      samples will be collected in a subset of patients who voluntarily consent to the PK portion

      of the study. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. An interim analysis of overall

      survival (OS) will be performed after approximately 308 participants have died. The final

      analysis of OS will occur when approximately 514 deaths have been observed.

    <brief_summary>

      This is a Phase 3 clinical study, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an

      investigational drug PLX3397 in the treatment of tumour of pigmented villonodular synovitis

      or giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath in subjects, for whom surgical removal of the

      tumour would cause more harm than good. The main purpose of this study is to gather

      information about the investigational drug PLX3397, which may help to treat these tumours.



      The study consists of two parts. In Part 1, eligible study participants will be assigned to

      receive either PLX3397 or matching placebo for 24 weeks. A number of assessments will be

      carried out during the course of the study, including physical examinations, blood tests,

      imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. MRI scans will be used to evaluate

      the response of the tumour to the treatment which will be independently assessed by central

      readers blinded to the treatment assignment. Those subjects, whether assigned to PLX3397 or

      matching placebo, who have completed Part 1 (i.e, complete 24 weeks of dosing and the Week

      25 assessments) will be eligible to advance to Part 2, a long-term treatment phase in which

      all subjects will receive open-label PLX3397

      This study will assess the effectiveness of a portable goggle system in the diagnosis of

      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in athletes.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this research study is to assess oculomotor, vestibular and reaction time

      responses in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) athletes, as well as healthy individuals.

      These measurements will be recorded using a portable goggle system (IPAS). The goal is to

      determine whether this IPAS goggle system is effective at diagnosing mTBI. A secondary goal

      is to determine whether this IPAS goggle system is effective at ruling out the diagnosis of

      mTBI in athletes and non-athletes that do not have the condition.



      The IPAS is a portable 3D head mounted display. The IPAS goggles are programmed with a

    <brief_summary>

      The investigators propose to evaluate whether an innovative collaborative connected health

      (CCH) model increases access to specialists and improves patient outcomes. CCH offers

      multiple modalities for patients and primary care providers (PCPs) to access dermatologists

      online directly and asynchronously to maximize effectiveness in a real-world setting. CCH

      also fosters team care and patient engagement through active sharing of management plans and

      multidirectional, informed communication among patients, PCPs, and dermatologists. The

      specific aims of the proposal are to (1) determine whether the CCH model results in

      equivalent improvements in psoriasis disease severity compared to in-person care, (2)

      determine whether the CCH model results in equivalent improvements in quality of life and

      mental health compared to in-person care, and (3) assess whether the CCH model provides

      better access to care than in-person care.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The investigators propose to conduct a 12-month, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to

      evaluate the impact of a collaborative connected health model for psoriasis management

      compared to inperson care. The pragmatic trial will compare psoriasis severity,

      quality-of-life, mental health, and access-to-care between the two models. We will enroll

      300 psoriasis patients from Colorado and California. In addition to recruiting patients from

      the general population, we will place a specific emphasis on recruiting psoriasis patients

      living in rural and underserved communities. We will also recruit from the full disease

      spectrum of mild, moderate, and severe psoriasis patients. We will use an intention-to-treat

      approach to analyze outcomes and perform longitudinal data analysis using repeated measures

      approach to identify potential differences in the trend over time between the two arms. To

      evaluate the utility of CCH for increasing access from patients' and clinicians'

      perspective, the study team will conduct key informant interviews and use qualitative

      analytical techniques with investigator triangulation and member checking to enhance the

      validity of the conclusions.

    <official_title>A Phase III Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of MK-1439A Once-Daily Versus ATRIPLA™ Once-Daily in Treatment-Naïve HIV-1 Infected Subjects</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the antiretroviral activity of MK-1439A, a

      single-tablet, once-daily (q.d.) fixed-dose combination (FDC) containing MK-1439 100 mg +

      lamivudine 300 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg, with ATRIPLA™, a single-tablet FDC

      containing efavirenz 600 mg + emtricitabine 200 mg + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg,

      in treatment-naive participants infected with HIV. The primary hypothesis is that MK-1439A

      q.d. is non-inferior to ATRIPLA™ q.d. as assessed by the proportion of participants with

      HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL (by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay) at Week 48.

      This study will test the theory that therapy designed for each individual's tumor will

      improve outcomes over standard of care in a population that needs a better standard.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.



      SEQUENCING:



      DNA from archived tumor samples collected at the time of surgery (residual disease post

      neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will be extracted and sequenced. The resulting sequencing data

      will be interrogated for known genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA

      approved agents.



      CANCER GENOMICS TUMOR BOARD (CGTB):



      Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data

      alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation. The CGTB will

      consider the genomic data along with the patient's prior treatment history, ongoing

      toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by the

      sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that

      therapy. All participants and investigators will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB

      deliberations until the time of relapse.



      PARTICIPANTS WITH A CGTB TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION:



      Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to Experimental Arm A

      (genomically directed monotherapy) or Control Arm B (standard therapy).



      EXPERIMENTAL ARM A (GENOMICALLY DIRECTED MONOTHERAPY):



      Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA approved drug at standard

      dose for four cycles (12-16 weeks total duration, depending on cycle length). Clinical and

      laboratory monitoring and dose-reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines.



      TOP GENOMIC ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS/PATHWAYS AND DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS:



        1. PIK3CA, PTEN: Everolimus



        2. TOP2A: Doxorubicin



        3. PARP1, BRCA1: Cisplatin and Olaparib



        4. VEGFA: Bevacizumab



        5. TYMP: Capecitabine



        6. SSTR2: Octreotide



        7. MGMT: Temozolomide



        8. MYC: Paclitaxel



        9. EGFR: Cetuximab



       10. COX2: Celecoxib



       11. hENT: Gemcitabine



       12. MET: Crizotinib



      CONTROL ARM B (STANDARD THERAPY); Recently, a randomized phase III trial of over 900

      HER2-negative patients demonstrated an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) and

      overall survival (OS) for the addition of 8 cycles of capecitabine in the post-neoadjuvant

      setting. The hazard ratios were also significant in the triple negative subgroup. Thus,

      capecitabine can be considered a standard option in this setting. As this represents only a

      single trial (with prior data not demonstrating benefit for the addition of capecitabine in

      the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings in unselected patients), observation can be considered

      an option as directed by the treating physician. While not recommended, other therapies can

      be used as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.



      In the event of disease progression on the control arm, patient sequencing results will be

      forwarded to the treating physician.



      PARTICIPANTS WITH NO CGTB RECOMMENDATION:



      Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) sequencing did not identify a

      matched drug or 2) the matched drug was contraindicated. These participants will be assigned

      to Control Arm B and treated as described above for Control Arm B. As the outcome of

      participants without an 'actionable' genomically directed therapy may differ, the primary

      analysis will include only participants randomized to Control Arm B.



      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 within 14 days prior

      to study registration



      Life Expectancy: Not Specified

        Inclusion Criteria:



          -  Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-)

             invasive breast cancer, clinical stage I-III at diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on

             initial evaluation by physical examination and/or breast imaging prior to study

             registration. NOTE: ER, PR and HER2 status will be confirmed by central pathology

             review prior to randomization. ER and PR will be considered negative if ≤ 1% of cells

             stain weakly positive. HER2 will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by

             immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC associated with a fluorescence in situ

             hybridization (FISH) ratio of &lt; 2.0 or &lt; 6 copies per cell.



          -  Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. NOTE: Acceptable

             preoperative regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Participants who

             received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Participants

             may not have received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to randomization.

             Bisphosphonate use is allowed.



          -  Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. The most recent surgery

             for breast cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior (but no more than

             84 days prior) to study registration. NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and

             ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive

             margins may enroll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and

             patient has received radiotherapy. Participants with margins positive for lobular

             carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible. Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery

             (including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.



          -  Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of definitive surgery

             following preoperative chemotherapy. Significant residual disease is defined as at

             least one of the following:



               -  Residual Cancer Burden (RBC) classification II or III6



               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 2 cm. The presence of

                  DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the breast.



               -  Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1cm with any lymph

                  node involvement (does not include metastases in lymph node which are only

                  detected by immunohistochemistry).



               -  Any lymph node involvement that results in 20% cellularity or greater regardless

                  of primary tumor site involvement (includes no residual disease in the breast).



          -  Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or greater. NOTE: Prior

             to randomization, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by central pathology review

             and percent values will be double checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing

             Company).



          -  BREAST RADIOTHERAPY:



               -  Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who underwent

                  breast-conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy.

                  Participants must have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no

                  more than 84 days prior) to study registration.



               -  Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is required for all participants with a primary

                  tumor ≥ 5 cm or involvement of ≥ 4 lymph nodes. For participants with primary

                  tumors &lt; 5 cm or with &lt; 4 involved lymph nodes, provision of post-mastectomy

                  radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician. Study registration

                  must occur within 84 days of completion of radiation.



               -  For radiation required prior to surgery, the participant must register within 84

                  days of surgery. Also, participants in this situation would not be required to

                  have additional post-mastectomy radiation therapy.



               -  For those participants who do not require radiation, registration must be within

                  84 days of surgery.



          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.



          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health

             information. HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or may be

             obtained separately. NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after

             definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre-registered to the study and

             proceed with central pathology review before full eligibility has been confirmed.

             However ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and formal study registration

             completed prior to submission of the sample for sequencing.



          -  Must consent to allow submission of adequate archived tumor tissue sample from

             definitive surgery for genomic assessment of tumor.



          -  Must consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic analysis



          -  Women and men of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of

             contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the

             time consent is signed until 4 weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.



          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days

             prior to study registration. Women should be counseled regarding acceptable birth

             control methods to utilize from the time of screening to start of treatment. If prior

             to treatment after discussion with the subject it is felt by the treating physician

             there is a possibility the subject is pregnant a pregnancy test should be repeated.



        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 30 days prior

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well temozolomide and veliparib work and

      compare them to temozolomide alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma

      multiforme. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop

      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or

      by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking

      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is more

      effective with or without veliparib in treating glioblastoma multiforme.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Test whether the experimental combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) combined with TMZ

      (temozolomide), compared to the control of placebo combined with TMZ, significantly extends

      overall survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients with tumor

      O-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter

      hypermethylation.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Test whether the experimental treatment significantly extends progression-free survival.



      II. Test whether the experimental treatment improves objective tumor response. III. Test

      whether the experimental treatment is associated with significantly greater rates of grade 3

      or higher adverse events.



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Evaluate the utility of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and diffusion weighted

      imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in defining time to progression in

      the setting of a large multi-institutional clinical trial.



      II. Test the concordance between site-determined MGMT methylation status and central

      laboratory determination of MGMT status in cases with local testing.



      III. Evaluate whether genetic or epigenetic alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)

      repair or replication genes are associated with overall survival, progression-free survival,

      and objective tumor response.



      IV. Test whether polymorphisms in MGMT, poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase

      1 (PARP1), or other DNA repair proteins, are associated with overall survival,

      progression-free survival, objective tumor response, or rates of grade 3 or higher adverse

      events.



      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.



      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and veliparib

      PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the

      absence of disease progression (confirmed progression) or unacceptable toxicity.



      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide as in Arm I and placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Treatment

      repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression (confirmed

      progression) or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years,

      every 6 months for 2 years.

    <brief_summary>

      To establish a new treatment option for treatment-naïve participants with HIV-1, the

      efficacy and safety of doravirine will be determined relative to a protease inhibitor (PI).

      Participants will receive double-blind treatment during the 96-week Base Study. Eligible

      participants in either of the Base Study groups from sites in Argentina, Australia, Canada,

      Chile, the United States, or Puerto Rico will continue to receive the doravirine-containing

      regimen open label for an additional 96 weeks in the Extension Study. The primary hypothesis

      is that doravirine 100 mg once a day (q.d.) is non-inferior to darunavir/ritonavir (800

      mg/100 mg) q.d., each in combination with TRUVADA™ or EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™, as assessed by the

      proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 48. If

      non-inferiority is established, then the superiority of doravirine 100 mg q.d. compared to

      darunavir/ ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d. will be assessed.

    <brief_summary>

      Phase II gene therapy study, involving a total of 6 male patients with choroideremia. The

      study will be conducted at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami. Patients

      will be required to attend a total of 11 study visits over a 24 month period with an

      additional 3 year follow-up.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This is a Phase II, open label study involving patients with a clinical phenotype of

      choroideremia and a confirmed CHM genotype. Following consent, patients will be required to

      attend an initial screening visit (Visit 1). Within 2 weeks of the screening visit patients

      will undergo a surgical procedure (Visit 2) under general anesthesia which will include a

      standard vitrectomy, retinal detachment and administration of a subretinal injection of

      AAV2-REP1 (1x1011 genome particles). Patients will be required to attend a further 9 study

      visits (Visits 3-11) over a 24 month period for functional, and anatomical assessments as

      well as monitoring of adverse events. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in

      visual acuity in the study eye, compared to control eye. Secondary study endpoints are,

      change from baseline in autofluorescence evaluation, microperimetry readings and other

      anatomic and functional outcomes (all in the study eye compared to control eye). Secondary

      endpoints also include safety assessments to be conducted throughout the study. The fellow

      eyes of these patients will be utilized as controls in this study and will receive no study

      treatment.

    <official_title>A Multicenter, Observational Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) in Subjects With Mantle Cell Lymphoma Who Have Relapsed or Progressed After Treatment With Ibrutinib or Are Refractory or Intolerant to Ibrutinib.</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of lenalidomide in subjects

      with relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) following ibrutinib treatment. MCL

      subjects who require treatment after receiving ibrutinib therapy are considered a population

      with high unmet medical need. It is therefore of benefit to have data on the outcomes of

      treatment options available in this patient population.



      An observational study design was chosen to collect the clinical data already existing or

      being collected for MCL subjects being treated with lenalidomide.



      MCL subjects who received lenalidomide either as monotherapy or as combination treatment

      after having relapsed or progressed on ibrutinib treatment or were refractory or intolerant

      to ibrutinib treatment are eligible for the study. Lenalidomide does not need to be the next

      subsequent treatment after ibrutinib.

      To evaluate the relative efficacy of three commonly utilized regional corticosteroids for

      the regional treatment of uveitic macular edema: periocular triamcinolone acetonide;

      intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal dexamethasone implant. The primary

      efficacy measure will be percent change in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT at

      8 weeks. Participants will continue in the study for 24 weeks in order to evaluate relative

      effects of the 3 treatment strategies on the duration of treatment effects, requirement for

      additional injections, and adverse effects.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Macular edema is the most common structural complication and leading cause of visual loss in

      patients with uveitis. Regional injections of corticosteroids are the most frequently used

      treatments specifically for uveitic macular edema but there is a lack of high quality

      evidence to guide choice of drug (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone) and route of

      administration (e.g. periocular, intravitreal). The question of how to approach regional

      treatment of uveitic macular edema is a key question for ophthalmologists treating these

      patients. The Periocular and Intravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema (POINT)

      Trial is a randomized trial designed to compare the relative efficacy of three regional

      corticosteroids commonly utilized for the initial regional treatment of uveitic macular

      edema, periocular triamcinolone (Kenalog® , Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ),

      intravitreal triamcinolone (Triesence™, Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Fort Worth, TX), and the

      intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex®, Allergan, Irvine CA) will be conducted by the

      MUST Research Group clinical centers throughout the U.S. and one each in Australia and the

      UK. After signing informed consent and undergoing eligibility evaluation, eligible patients

      will be randomized to one of the three study treatments to be administered at the first

      study visit. Randomization is by participant, if both eyes meet eligibility requirements

      then both eyes receive assigned treatment. The design outcome is the percent change in

      central subfield macular thickness on OCT from baseline to the 8 week visit. After

      assessment of the primary outcome at 8 weeks, second injections and best medical judgment

      will be used if macular edema has not improved as follows:



      Eye(s) meeting trial eligibility criteria receive initial injection of assigned treatment at

      P01 visit.



      Second injection of assigned treatment permitted at 8 week visit for periocular

      triamcinolone and intravitreal triamcinolone and at 12 week visit for intravitreal

      dexamethasone if



        -  Eye does not meet the improvement definition (a 20% decrease in central subfield

           thickness of the macula) or



        -  Eye has a normal central subfield thickness but has cystoid spaces in the 1 mm central

           subfield or



        -  ME is worse after initial improvement



      And the following repeat injection criteria are met:



        -  IOP of ≤21 or mm Hg and treatment with ≤2 IOP-lowering agents;



        -  Best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or worse;



      Eyes demonstrating no improvement or worsening of ME as measured by the central submacular

      thickness on OCT (at week 12 for periocular and intravitreal triamcinolone arms and at week

      20 for intravitreal dexamethasone arm) are considered primary treatment non-responders.

      assess the safety and efficacy of farletuzumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in

      subjects with low CA125 platinum sensitive ovarian cancer in first relapse.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be enrolled in a targeted 1:1 stratification ratio into 1 of 2 chemotherapy

      treatment arms at the investigator's discretion: carboplatin plus paclitaxel or carboplatin

      plus Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD), and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive

      weekly farletuzumab 5 mg/kg or placebo (ie, Test Article). All subjects will receive a

      loading dose for the first 2 weeks of 10 mg/kg Test Article (farletuzumab or placebo).

      Subjects will be stratified at randomization by individual chemotherapy treatment regimen

      (targeted 1:1 ratio) and platinum-free interval following first-line therapy (6 to 12 months

      vs greater than 12 to 36 months).

      Primary Objective:



      Demonstrate clinical benefit of Toujeo in achieving individualized HEDIS HbA1c targets (&lt;8%

      if age 65 years or with defined comorbidities (as listed in Appendix G) or otherwise &lt;7%) at

      6 months without documented symptomatic (BG 70mg/dl) hypoglycemia at any time of day from

      baseline to 6 months in uncontrolled insulin naive patients with type 2 diabetes initiating

      basal insulin therapy in a real world setting.



      Secondary Objectives:



      Compare Toujeo to other commercially available basal insulins at 6 and 12 months after

      initiating insulin therapy in a real world setting in terms of:



        -  Patient persistence with assigned basal insulin therapy



        -  Risk of hypoglycemia including the incidence and rate of documented symptomatic and

           severe hypoglycemia



        -  Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, body weight



        -  Differences in patient- and provider- reported outcomes (including Diabetes Treatment

           Satisfaction Questionnaire Status and Change Versions DTSQs and DTSQc), Hypoglycemia

           Patient Questionnaire, and patient and provider reported Global Effectiveness Scale

           (GES)



        -  Healthcare resource utilization including hospitalizations and emergency department or

           other provider visits and healthcare costs.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The total study duration per patient will be up to 53 weeks, consisting of a 1-week

      screening period at the site, a 26-week treatment period, and a 26-week extension period.

      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of injecting ones own

      Schwann cells to augment sural nerve autografts after a severe, non-lacerating injury to the

      sciatic nerve has occurred.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      The secondary purpose of this research project is to evaluate whether transplanted Schwann

      cells can enhance recovery of sensory and motor function. Emergency expanded access for a

      single patient was granted, as the patient was an ideal candidate for sural nerve repair

      augmented by autologous Schwann cells which could be harvested from a relatively small

      segment of sensory nerve. The cells were expanded using cell culture techniques and placed

      along with the sural nerve grafts wrapped by an FDA approved collagen matrix (Duragen). This

      study is being conducted at the Jackson Memorial and the University of Miami health systems.

      As a research subject the patient will be in this study for a total of 5 years from the date

      receiving Schwann cell transplant augmentation of sural nerve autografts.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial compares how well combination chemotherapy works when given

      with or without bortezomib in treating patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute

      lymphoblastic leukemia or stage II-IV T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bortezomib may help

      reduce the number of leukemia or lymphoma cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for

      cell growth. It may also help chemotherapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive

      to the drugs. It is not yet known if giving standard chemotherapy with or without bortezomib

      is more effective in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic

      lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute

      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) who are randomized

      to a modified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (ABFM) backbone versus bortezomib plus the

      modified ABFM backbone.



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of modifying standard therapy for T-ALL and T-LLy

      based on the results of UKALL 2003, which includes a dexamethasone-based induction,

      additional doses of pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) during induction and delayed intensification

      (DI), and dexamethasone pulses during maintenance therapy.



      II. To determine if prophylactic (presymptomatic) cranial irradiation (CRT) can be safely

      and effectively eliminated in the 85-90% of T-ALL patients classified as standard or

      intermediate risk.



      III. To determine the proportion of end of consolidation (EOC) minimal residual disease

      (MRD) &gt;= 0.1% T-ALL patients who become MRD negative (undetectable by flow cytometry) after

      intensification of chemotherapy, using three high risk (HR) BFM blocks, and to compare EFS

      between the patients who become MRD negative after the three HR BFM blocks and continue on

      chemotherapy with those who continue to have detectable MRD and are eligible for other

      treatment strategies, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Similarly, to

      compare the EFS between very high risk (induction failure) T-LLy patients treated with HR

      BFM intensification blocks who have partial or complete response (PR or CR) with those who

      do not respond (NR).



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To investigate the prognostic significance of day 29 bone marrow (BM) MRD in T-LLy

      patients.



      II. To determine if protein expression patterns can predict bortezomib response and drug

      resistance in T-ALL.



      III. To analyze and target relevant signaling pathways in T-ALL blasts, focusing on early T

      cell precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

    <brief_summary>

      This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating younger

      patients with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic desmoplastic medulloblastoma. Drugs used in

      chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide, and

      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the

      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Estimate of the progression free survival (PFS) distribution for patients 0-&lt;4 years of

      age with M0 desmoplastic medulloblastoma (nodular desmoplastic or medulloblastoma with

      extensive nodularity) treated with the modified HIT SKK regimen (excluding the use of

      intraventricular methotrexate).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. Evaluate the feasibility of a rapid central pathology screening review for treatment

      allocation according to histology and assess agreement between institutional and central

      pathology review diagnoses as well as among central pathology review diagnoses.



      II. Prospectively evaluate the molecular profile of nodular desmoplastic

      (ND)/medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) medulloblastoma in young children.



      III. Monitor and describe the neurocognitive and adaptive functioning of young children with

      ND/MBEN medulloblastoma treated on this protocol using the ALTE07C1 protocol.



      OUTLINE:



      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute or

      infused via minibag on days 1, 15, and 29; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3;

      methotrexate IV over 24 hours on days 15 and 29; etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days

      43-45; and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 43-45. Treatment repeats every 63 days for 3

      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      CONTINUATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute or infused via

      minibag on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, etoposide IV over 60-120

      minutes on days 21-23, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 21-23. Treatment repeats every

      42 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.



      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24,

      36, 48, 60, and 72 months.

    <brief_summary>

      This randomized phase III trial studies how well blinatumomab works compared with standard

      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that

      has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Monoclonal antibodies, such as

      blinatumomab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not

      yet known whether standard combination chemotherapy is more effective than blinatumomab in

      treating relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To compare disease free survival (DFS) of high-risk (HR) and intermediate-risk (IR)

      relapse B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients who are randomized following

      induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks or two

      5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR randomization).



      II. To compare the DFS of low risk (LR) relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following

      block 1 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab

      (LR randomization).



      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To compare overall survival (OS) of HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized

      following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks

      or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (HR/IR randomization).



      II. To compare OS of LR relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized following block 1

      chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab (LR

      randomization).



      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:



      I. To compare the rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) &gt;= 0.01% at the end of block 2 and

      block 3 for HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients in HR/IR randomization.



      II. To estimate, for treatment failure (TF) patients not previously receiving blinatumomab,

      the hematologic complete remission rate (CR), rate of MRD &lt; 0.01%, and proportion able to

      proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in CR after treatment with

      blinatumomab.



      III. To assess the feasibility and safety of rapid taper of immune suppression for the

      subset of HSCT patients with MRD &gt;= 0.01% pre- and/or post-HSCT with no acute graft versus

      host disease (aGVHD).



      IV. To evaluate blinatumomab pharmacokinetics (PK) and explore exposure-response

      relationships for measures of safety and effectiveness.

    <brief_summary>

      Dry eye symptoms can occur after LASIK surgery. They generally get better with time but in

      some patients, they can persist. The investigators believe that in some individuals, dry eye

      symptoms after LASIK persist because the nerves in the cornea become hypersensitive. The

      investigators wish to study if a medication, called pregabalin, can protect corneal nerves

      at the time of LASIK surgery and decrease the frequency and severity of dry eye symptoms 6

      months after surgery. This medication has been used in a similar way to reduce the frequency

      of uncomfortable sensations after other surgeries (knee, abdomen) but has never been studied

      in LASIK surgery.

    <official_title>An Exploratory Phase II Study to Determine the Tolerability, Safety, and Activity of a Novel Vasopressin 1a Receptor Antagonist (SRX246) in Irritable Subjects With Huntington's Disease (HD)</official_title>

    <brief_summary>

      This study evaluates the tolerability, safety and activity of SRX246 in the treatment of

      irritability in patients with Huntington's disease. Two-thirds of all participants will

      receive SRX246, while the other third will receive a placebo.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      SRX246 is a first-in-class vasopressin 1a (V1a) receptor antagonist that crosses the

      blood-brain barrier following oral administration. The molecule exhibits high affinity and

      high selectivity for its target receptor. Preclinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated

      significant CNS effects in models of irritability, including impulsive aggression,

      depression, and anxiety. In an experimental medicine fMRI study in healthy volunteers,

      SRX246 treatment significantly attenuated the effect of intranasal AVP in brain circuits

      known to modulate emotional responses to stimuli that elicit aggression/fear. Together,

      these findings suggest that SRX246 has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for major

      neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in HD patients.



      This is a 3-arm, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12 week, dose

      escalation study of SRX246 in irritable Subjects with early symptomatic HD.



      Following an initial screening visit, Subjects fulfilling the study inclusion and exclusion

      criteria will enter a pre-treatment screening phase to permit evaluations to confirm

      eligibility for inclusion into the study. This screening phase will be no longer than 30

      days. At the completion of the screening period, eligible Subjects will be randomized at

      baseline visit to receive either placebo or final doses of SRX246 of 120 mg twice daily or

      160 mg twice daily during the double-blind treatment phase. At baseline, Subjects in the

      active groups will receive 80 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, then escalate to 120 mg twice

      daily for 4 weeks. Then one group of Subjects will continue to take 120 mg of SRX246 twice

      daily for an additional 6 weeks, and the second group of Subjects will increase their dose

      to 160 mg of SRX246 twice daily for 6 weeks. Total dosing duration is 12 weeks.



      Subjects in the placebo group will receive a similar number of capsules that are identical

      in appearance to the capsules that contain SRX246 during the trial, in order to preserve the

      blind.



      In all groups, dose escalation will occur (stepwise) if patients have not experienced

      dose-limiting adverse effects. Patients who cannot tolerate their final dose of drug (or

      placebo) can have this dose reduced without compromising the blinding.



      Subjects will have periodic visits either "in-person" or by "telephone", to assess

      tolerability, safety, and several measures of irritability and other problem behaviors, and

      clinical assessments for activity signals.

          6. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., those not postmenopausal or surgically

             sterile) must have a negative pregnancy test, be non-lactating and use adequate

             contraception methods during the study. Adequate birth control includes: abstinence;

             oral, implanted or injected contraceptives, e.g., birth control pills; intra-uterine

             device; barrier (vaginal ring or diaphragm/cervical cap with spermicide); transdermal

             patch. Reliable contraception must have been in use 30 days prior to the Baseline

             Visit. Partner(s) contraception (e.g., male partner with vasectomy or other surgical

             contraception) is acceptable.



          7. Men must agree not to father a child during the study and one month after and to use

             contraception. Barrier with spermicide or surgical contraception is acceptable.

          9. Sufficient English skills to complete all assessments without assistance of an

             English language interpreter. Subjects with HD who cannot read or write might qualify

             for enrollment in the study. Site PIs will have to decide in each case whether the

             Subject can understand and fully participate with help from his/her Informant.



         10. Availability of a responsible Informant (referred to as a "study partner" in the

             consent document) who has good English skills, is familiar with the Subject, and is

             able and willing to comply with all required study procedures, ensuring that the

             patient attends all study visits and takes the study medicine as instructed. The

             study partner must spend time with the patient a minimum of 4 times per week on 4

      To evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon, Spectranetics)

      within the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients.

    </brief_summary>
    <detailed_description>

      This study will evaluate the use of an occlusion balloon (Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon,

      Spectranetics) within the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients. This will be

      performed in a non-emergent setting to allow for evaluation of how best to integrate this

      new technology into the investigators clinical practice. The study will focus on the effect

      of the Bridge balloon on the patient preparation clinical workflow, ease of

      insertion/positioning/deployment, and the ability to recognize proper inflation and vein

      sealing under fluoroscopy. Understanding these factors will help build a more robust

      clinical workflow with the goal of better patient outcomes in the case of an Superior Vena

      Cava injury. The images and data generated during this study can help in dissemination of

      the practical use knowledge to fellow lead extractors.
